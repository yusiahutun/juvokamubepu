"I was like, 'what?' The first thing I saw was the censored one and it had like the black thing over it. And I was like oh my goodness like, 'I don't know what this is gonna look like', and then it wasn't like as bad as I thought it was gonna be. It wasn't like terrible."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/78/16by9/2015/11/09/78883f82495f549b80e0a1f6e95d2d23_md.jpeg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=visually-hidden>Play video content</span><p>"Well I'm no expert, but I hear it was good," Ellen laughed.</p><p>But Ellen wasn't done grilling the Biebs yet though! Later in the show, the host asked Justin to reveal which songs on the new album wereabout his famous ex <strong>Selena Gomez</strong>!</p><p>Although he remained tight lipped, only copping to singing about the star in <strong>"Sorry"</strong> and <strong>"Mark My Words,"</strong> he did open up about constantly seeing Selena due to her superstar status.</p><p>"It is tough," he admitted. "There is a lot of stuff that reminds me of her. You know in relationships, you see stuff on TV and you are like, 'I remember we used to watch this and I remember that smell.'"</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b9/o/2015/11/09/b9ad78fc528755f5bd2403a571ec0fa9_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p>"We have a lot of history together and I am sure it could possibly happen," he added when asked if he would get back together with the <strong>"Same Old Love"</strong> singer. "I think we are both just on our own journeys and figuring ourselves out and I think maybe once we figure ourselves out we can come back and make an awesome duo or she finds someone awesome and I'll find someone awesome. I just want her to be happy."</p><p>What do you think of Justin's candid comments?

After dinner, guests were eager to hit the dance floor, where they were greeted by tunes courtesy of DJ Valentina.</p><p>The wedding served as a celebration of the couple's 18-year romance. Roberts and Laign met in 2005, on a blind date set up by mutual friends.</p><p>Roberts announced the couple's wedding plans &nbsp;back in January during an episode of GMA.</p><p>"I'm saying yes to marriage! We're getting married this year," Roberts revealed when asked what she would be saying "yes" to in 2023. "It's something we talked about, but we put it off, she became ill."</p><p>In February 2022, Roberts and Laign revealed Laign's diagnosis with breast cancer. She completed radiation therapy in July. Roberts also publicly battled breast cancer after her own diagnosis in 2007.</p><p>The official marriage proposal came at the end of 2022. With the couple deciding to wed while eating at one of their favorite restaurants together in Connecticut, where they put calamari rings on each other's fingers.</p><p>"We took the calamari rings and we slapped them on each other's fingers and we just we proposed to one another," Roberts recalled during the popular morning show. "Now looking back, it was pretty fitting for us to not have a down on one knee [proposal] and one person doing it... it was just us hanging out in our little hole-in-the-wall Mexican spot and putting calamari rings on each other and saying, 'Let's go. Let's do it.'"</p><a id=gallery-link-ef1a08ec-e711-4136-81d3-b385f33accd0 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ef1a08ec-e711-4136-81d3-b385f33accd0 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:6cecbf9c-dd10-4097-9b35-f7f21b491f6a data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ec/4by3/2021/06/05/ec06697981824915aba9d59158c0f197_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jmamlfp7yjtc1mqaialafBtHnAppmeql2hrqqzzWaZmpubrq6zsIywnJ2cmaO0cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebs-copied-knickerless-athena-tennis-girl.html><span>←</span><span>From Amanda Holden to Alan Carr, Rhian Sugden rates cheeky celebs who copied the knickerless Athena</span></a>

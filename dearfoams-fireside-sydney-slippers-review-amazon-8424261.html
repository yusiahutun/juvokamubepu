I don’t mean the nervous, indecisive feeling that rears its ugly head before a big meeting or event —&nbsp;rather, the area&nbsp; from my ankles to my pinky toes is quite literally always freezing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although I’ve failed to pinpoint the actual reason behind my perpetually cold feet, I have gone to great lengths over the years to keep my feet warm and toasty. That's meant procuring <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>an array of fuzzy socks</a>, stealing pairs of slippers from every hotel I've ever stayed in, wrapping myself in every blanket I can find, and of course, breaking the oh-so-controversial rule of "no socks in bed.” But it wasn't until a few months ago, when I discovered the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dearfoams Fireside Sydney Slippers</a>, that I found a lasting solution to my cold feet.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At first glance, they may look no different from the hundreds, if not thousands, of similar slippers on the market today; but in actuality, they are so much more. Made with 100 percent Australian shearling, the sheepskin slippers are an unending source of warmth and comfort, while a memory foam sole molds to the shape of your feet to hug them with every step. Unlike other fur-lined slippers and shoes, however, these are naturally moisture-wicking, meaning they never cause feet to feel sweaty, sticky, or overheated. The open-back design only furthers this temperature-regulating effect, making the Fireside slippers ideal for year-round wear, from the coldest of winter nights to the hottest summer day.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">slip-on Dearfoams</a> are also as versatile as they come. They’re available in 21 different colors —&nbsp;including fun styles like metallic and camo — and sizes 6 to 11 (half sizes and wide options included). With durable yet lightweight outsoles made from rubber-like EVA, these slippers can be worn both indoors and outdoors, so you truly never have to take them off or abandon the warmth they provide. And the best part? The outsoles are tough enough to survive constant wear and virtually any kind of surfaces without deteriorating or getting holes, as so many slippers do. I’ve worn mine every day since they arrived, around the house, in the yard, and embarrassing as it may be, even to take my dog out on walks around the neighborhood.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Dearfoams Fireside Sydney Slippers are genuinely the most comfortable and lasting slippers my feet have ever had the privilege of wearing, and they have made my chronic cold feet a thing of the past. And I’m not the only one —&nbsp;more than 12,600 Amazon shoppers have left them a five-star review, raving that you “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">have to get them</a>” and that they’re <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">comparable to much pricier options</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, I love them so much that I decided to gift the slippers to every member of my family this holiday season. And while they may have only had them a few weeks, my family has already fallen just as in love as I. You, too, can keep your feet warm and cozy all winter long with the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dearfoams Fireside Sydney Slippers</a> — snag them on sale for up to 57 percent off at Amazon while you still have the chance.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w56Yq56flrq0ecWiqZ6rmZmybr%2FYnaWesV2ouaq8z56prGWimsOqsdZmmKaZqqS7boSTa2trbmE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gigi-hadids-cute-daughter-khai-seen-in-rare-photos-and-shes-growing-so-fast.html><span>←</span><span>Gigi Hadid's cute daughter Khai seen in rare photos and she's 'growing so fast'</span></a>

It was scary to watch,” John’s late girlfriend Donna Pescow shared. Director John Badham added, “By noon of the first day, we had to shut down and go home.” Because of this, they had to start filming the movie in the middle of the night and during the early morning hours!</p><p>In 1983, John reprised his Tony Manero role in a sequel called Staying Alive after the success of the first film, and in a previous interview, John revealed it was his co-star Diana Hyland who convinced him to take on the part in the first place. “I got the script, I read it that night,” John told <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>. “I wondered if I could give it enough dimension. Diana took it into the other room, and in about an hour she burst back in. ‘Baby, you are going to be great in this—great! This Tony, he’s got all the colors! First he’s angry about something. He hates the trap that Brooklyn and his dumb job are. There’s a whole glamorous world out there waiting for him, which he feels only when he dances. And he grows, he gets out of Brooklyn.’”</p><p>He then recalls answering, “‘He’s also king of the disco. I’m not that good a dancer.’ ‘Baby,’ she said, ‘you’re going to learn!’” John sure learned — and we can’t even imagine anyone else in that role!</p><p><b>Click through the gallery below to see the cast of <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> Then and now!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46smK2topmuunnNop6hrF2bsrex0WaamqukYsGpsc1mpaivXWZ%2Fd32YcmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./proenza-schouler-white-label.html><span>←</span><span>Proenza Schouler Launching New Line &amp;quot;White Label&amp;quot;</span></a>

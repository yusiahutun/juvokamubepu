An intensive two-week investigation proved fruitful: detectives traced the suspicious citruses to North Africa. Two stall owners and three sales staff were arrested, and 5,200 oranges and 112,000 forged labels seized. However, the original crime syndicate was never unpeeled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/04/27/73b30816-49fa-11e8-85b3-af25d27017e0_1320x770_181354.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Smartphones</strong></p>They say if it’s too good to be true, then it probably is – especially when it comes to suspiciously cheap smartphones.

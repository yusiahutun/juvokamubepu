Just when you thought the world has had enough of the Bachelor franchise, a rat dating game that's similar to the reality dating show comes out of nowhere. Yes, we said rat... like the rodent.&nbsp;
So, OK, the producers of the brand have nothing to do with the creation of the online game, but the fact that something like this exists is just kind of unbelievable."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We couldn't imagine if it was called different. You can find the game by typing in "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">algorat.club</a>" in the URL bar of your computer browser, and it will lead you to the alternate universe that is "The Ratchelor."</p><p>The homepage of the game consists of a background with many groups of rats and a picture of the brand's logo that includes its name, the "O" replaced with a ring, a bouquet of flowers, and some cheeses. Would you expect anything less?</p><p>The description of the game reads: "Play as The Ratchelor, a smoking hot rat. Slowly narrow down your love prospects until you find your soulmate." Sounds... quite interesting.</p><p>They also advertise the different features that you can also play around with while you're trying to find your match. A user can dress up their rat with a sweater of their choice or give their rat character a total makeover.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"The Ratchelor" is still very much a work in progress as it only dropped on Valentine's Day of 2021. Per their first Instagram post, the brand said that it's free and only available on desktop for the time being.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you to everyone who played it and left comments! You inspire us! üíñ this account is new but we‚Äôll post work in progress photos and slowly reveal all the endings here for those who haven‚Äôt played it yet it‚Äôs free and online (desktop only for now)!" the caption said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Their website states, "Algorat is a rat-centric computational arts collective. We are Char Stiles, Connie Ye, Tatyana Mustakos, and Caroline Hermans." By the sound of it, it appears that not only are these people the inventors of The Ratchelor, but also this animalistic internet world.&nbsp;</p><p>These individuals are all professionals in the designing and programming field, which is how they were able to build Algorat and "The Ratchelor" from the ground up.</p><p>Because the game and the overall site are still so fresh, we can probably expect for it to only keep on growing. Follow their Instagram account, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@alg0rat</a>, if you want to keep up with the latest news and updates around it and if you want to know about some alternate endings in the love lives of some of the rats. And definitely play the game if you're interested in dating in rat form!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp661ecGamqGdnKS%2FbrPAppw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rita-ora-ibiza-holiday-quirky-mix-and-match-manicure.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Rita Ora's 'weird girl' manicure is our current end-of-summer nail obsession</span></a>

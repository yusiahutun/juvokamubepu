I've always had to graft and work and that's why I'm still around after 17 years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">''I have always got something to prove because if CVs are anything to go by I wouldn't have to put my boots on. Now I have got to prove I am worthy of putting on the Eastern shirt and doing my job for the team.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">''I've been at clubs where 35 pros are fighting for 11 places and that's pressure. Now I am going into a Hong Kong derby that will be played at fever pitch and facing another kind of pressure - but I feel I am big enough to carry it.'' Sealy has only 10 days' full training behind him because of a groin strain and admits the big kick-off has come two weeks too early.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">''It's been very frustrating because I know I will not be 100 per cent match fit going into the game,'' he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">''But when you step over that white line you're the same as everyone else and are there to be shot down. It's an occupational hazard.'' Sealy's career has taken in an English League Cup final appearance with Southampton against Nottingham Forest at Wembley, a Lisbon derby for Sporting against Benfica in front of 103,000 fans in the city's Stadium of Light and a European Cup-Winners' Cup quarter-final tie for the Portuguese giants against Atalanta in Bergamo, Italy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Tempest's achievements with Eastern last season leave Sealy acknowledging: ''It's going to be a hard act to follow.''

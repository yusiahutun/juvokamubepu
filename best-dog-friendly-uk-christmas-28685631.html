data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>READ MORE: World's best Christmas markets – two UK winners and California beats Germany</a></p><p>That’s ignoring the bierkellers many stagger out of at the end of the night!</p><p>However, for those with pets it can become a bit trickier to find a Christmas market that’s suitable for a night out if you want to bring your dog along.</p><p>Thankfully Global travel site Big 7 Travel has teamed up with car comparison specialists <a href=# rel=nofollow>EnjoyTravel.com</a> to find the best dog-friendly Christmas markets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28686069.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Dog-wearing-reindeer-antlers-at-Christmas-time.jpg><p>At the top of the rankings was Bath Christmas Market – set in the city centre from November 24 to December 11 it’s full of festive cheer.</p><p>There are over 170 chalets filled with food, drink and presents and it’s a great choice for taking your dog with you.</p><p>Furry friends are accepted at the market and the staff will likely give your pooch a good pat – just be careful at busier times that they don’t get trampled underfoot by avoiding peak times.</p><p>Some hotels nearby that accept dogs include the Homewood Hotel & Spa and the Abbey Hotel.</p><p>In the second spot was Edinburgh Christmas Market – Scotland’s capital is a stunning city with gothic architecture and a Christmassy chill in the air.</p><p>There’s a huge Ferris wheel installed on the site, live shows all day long and a fab ice rink – although maybe don’t try and take your dog skating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28686092.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_SWNS_EDINBURGH_XMAS_019.jpg><p>The market is based in St Andrew’s Square until January 3 and it's very dog friendly!</p><p>Get them a sausage from one of the stalls – maybe leave off the mustard or curry sauce – and enjoy some wine yourself while wandering through the festive setting.</p><p>If you want to stay at a hotel nearby, then The Black Ivy and the Melville Castle Hotel both accept dogs in their rooms.</p><p>The third top spot was nabbed by Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park that accepts dogs.</p><p>There are plenty of traditional stalls at this enormous Christmas market which doesn’t close until January 2.</p><p>Furry friends are welcome at the event – which <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>we’ve reviewed</a> – but they will need to be comfortable with lots of fairground ride sounds, the smell of dozens of delicious food stalls and some loud music if you enter the incredible Bavarian Village.</p><p>Luckily, there’s something for your dog to snack on too as you can find handmade dog treats and warm coats for pups on sale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28686146.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_SWNS_LONDON_ABOVE_15.jpg><p>We’d recommend going at off-peak times such as in the morning and early afternoon as the evenings can get rammed with visitors – luckily off-peak times come with free entry too.</p><p>Stay nearby with your pooch at The Rubens at the Palace, Show London or South Place Hotel.</p><p>In the fourth top spot was Winchester Christmas Market which is set near the city’s cathedral.</p><p>It’s open from November 18 to December 22 and welcomes 400,000 visitors each year.</p><p>The beautiful city knows how to throw a good Christmas market with local art, Christmas crafts, tasty snacks and traditional carols.</p><p>The fun festive lighting will set the mood in this German style market as you take in the many events and concerts and do some shopping with your pip.</p><p>Stay at Lainston House or The King’s Head if you want to bring your pooch.</p><img

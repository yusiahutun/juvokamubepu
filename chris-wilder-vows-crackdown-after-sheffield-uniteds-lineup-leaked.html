Wilder was delighted with his side’s dogged display at Villa Park but angered about the pre-match leak and said he will take steps to prevent a repeat occurring against Luton on Boxing Day.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>“Everybody will know the team [for the game against Luton] by the way because it will come out on Twitter apparently at about half 10 on Boxing Day morning, so you’ll know the team pretty early,” Wilder said sarcastically of the incident.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>“I think it’s a joke. It is quite difficult to keep the team pretty much quiet but I’m not happy about that situation. If anybody thinks that team gets bandied about pretty easily, then they’ve got another thing coming. They are harming the football club. So whoever did it, I appreciate that, thanks very much.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><a data-ignore=global-link-styling href=# class=dcr-porppu>skip past newsletter promotion</a><p class=dcr-1ki5f>Sign up to <span>Football Daily</span></p><span class=dcr-ld1976>Free daily newsletter</span><p class=dcr-k17n11>Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football</p><span class=dcr-10ejt2b><strong>Privacy Notice: </strong>Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That did us no favours on Friday … it is a case of lesson learned on that for me as well. That person calls themselves a <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Sheffield United</a> fan? I’m not sure I’d call them that.”</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>Wilder praised his stand-in captain, Jack Robinson, who led United last Friday in the absence of the injured Anel Ahmedhodzic. Wilder signed Robinson from Nottingham Forest in January 2020, during his first spell in charge before returning this month after replacing Paul Heckingbottom.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>“I brought Jack in and he had an incredible job shifting Jack O’Connell,” Wilder said. “At the time I was having conversations with Gareth Southgate and it was between him [O’Connell] and Tyrone Mings to play left centre-half for England.</p><p class=dcr-1cmbxtt>“Tyrone came through and just got on the nod ahead of Jack and Jack then had an unfortunate situation with injury. Robbo has had to bide his time but while I’ve been away he has grown and matured and been outstanding.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJ6fpMGjrculZmtoYmh8pbHCaGlsZ5Odv6q%2FjLCgpZyVp3q3u9asZJyqkZi4pbvWp2SanqSav26%2Fx56dn6GVobFuwc2iq56co2K5qrrErqdmpJWWuKaw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pertemps-final-handicap-hurdle-cheltenham-festival-runners-odds.html><span>←</span><span>Cheltenham Festival 2022: Pertemps Final Handicap Hurdle entries, odds, trends and free bets</span></a>

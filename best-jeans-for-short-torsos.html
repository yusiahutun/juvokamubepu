Read: It can feel nearly impossible. As someone with a short torso I know this to be true. For as long as I can remember, I’ve searched for denim that’ll make me appear longer, leaner, and taller in all the right places. But, time and time again, I’ve ended up with jeans that drown my figure and make my already-short torso look even shorter — until now.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In order to find jeans that fit (and flatter) women with short torsos, we took it upon ourselves to uncover the best pairs available. To do so, we interviewed fashion experts to better understand what makes denim suitable for these figures. “The goal is to add length where possible,” explains Zadrian Smith of the styling duo Zadrian + Sarah. “When applying this to jeans, high-waisted options create a lengthening illusion. A flare is also a good pick as it adds lengths and balances your silhouette.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Complete with expert-recommended brands and styles, this curated list includes the top denim picks that work to elongate legs, compliment curves, and suit short torsos.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-veronica-beard-beverly-high-rise-skinny-flare></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Veronica Beard Beverly High Rise Skinny Flare</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Veronica Beard Beverly High Rise Skinny Flare" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nZ_cObp503ECrwYGYCaYV4RwHxU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Veronica-Beard-Beverly-High-Rise-Skinny-Flare-1fa822e608214103b1fb5edb60c3bb2a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Veronica Beard</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These comfortable jeans are made with a stretchy material that conforms to each body’s unique shape, ultimately accentuating curves.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They can stretch so much that it’s best to size down.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These top-rated Veronica Beard jeans feature subtle details that elongate short torsos. For starters, the flattering skinny-flare cut instantly lengthens legs by drawing attention downwards, which creates the illusion of more height. Made of a stretchy cotton-elastane blend, the silhouette beautifully hugs your body, keeping you comfortable while simultaneously accentuating curves and defining your waist. The high rise cut lays perfectly along the waistline, cinching it and making your midsection look longer, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love the timeless blue wash that’s easy to pair with anything, and we appreciate the jeans' versatility: They’re elegant enough to wear to the office when paired with heels, but also feel cool and casual with a pair of combat boots and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leather jacket</a>. The stretch is one of the key selling points of these, but we do recommend sizing down — this way the jeans will form to your body and will be less likely to lose shape over time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>23W—32W<strong> </strong>| <strong>Rise: </strong>High<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, elastomultiester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-abercrombie--fitch-mid-rise-90s-straight-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch Mid Rise 90s Straight Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch Mid Rise 90s Straight Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IvkGLL6xrHABFiUHRFb9UtQwfQg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Abercrombie--Fitch-Mid-Rise-90s-Straight-Jean-f53d8dd29582415ea27a56ea64b802fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These jeans are offered in five different lengths.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They need to be washed before first wear, otherwise the color can bleed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Abercrombie & Fitch has made a major comeback in recent years, offering a wide selection of clothing – including jeans – for relatively affordable prices. (We’re talking quality options for under $100.) We’re fans of the Mid-Rise Straight Jeans for its ​​classic ‘90s fit that flatters short torsos. Designed with a longer-than-average inseam, it creates the illusion of a taller midsection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Other unique design features make these jeans standout, too: Namely, we appreciate that they come in five length options — extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long. (Petite girls, this means you can find the right length for your body without having to go to a tailor.) They also come in three different washes – super light, light, and medium.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the low price, Abercrombie jeans are made to last. We’ve owned this pair for a few years and they continue to hold up wash after wash. Just be sure to throw them in the washer before your first&nbsp;wear to avoid color transfer (something we learned the hard way).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>23W—37W<strong> </strong>| <strong>Rise: </strong>Mid<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-closed-jeans-a-better-blue-aria></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Closed Jeans A Better Blue Aria</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Closed Jeans A Better Blue Aria" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yXp71P733w4y_iDIa5DIp53LCHw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Closed-Jeans-A-Better-Blue-Aria-2681293e5cd6420a813333e95542afbb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Closed</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This style features two large, angular pockets that are both practical and fashionable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> If you’re under five-foot-four, you’ll probably need to get these jeans hemmed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because denim is a timeless wardrobe staple, we recommend investing in a quality pair of jeans that will grow with you through the years. Closed is known for its exemplary Italian&nbsp;construction and modern silhouettes that flatter all body types. For those with short torsos, we like the Aria style for its slim fit, high waist, and flare cut that elongates the entire lower half of the body.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with the figure-enhancing shape, the details make these stand out in a sea of basic denim. The deep angular pockets make a statement and can hold an array of small items, including your phone and wallet, and the wide belt loops instantly draw more attention to the waist, making it look smaller. We will note that these are extremely long, so if you’re petite, you’ll most likely need to get them tailored.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>23W—34W | <strong>Rise: </strong>High<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-madewell-the-plus-perfect-vintage-flare-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Flare Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Plus Perfect Vintage Flare Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/t-NznaeOYR7f26ro4bnEhbRepuI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Madewell-The-Plus-Perfect-Vintage-Flare-Jeans-b3e13641c3274b86bd3bb620772696e1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The narrow waist guarantees a gap-free fit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They tend to sell out fast, so it might be hard to find certain sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Madewell recently updated its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Plus Collection</a> size range (which includes sizes 14W–28W and 1X–4X) to ensure the best fit for every body. One of the best pieces from the collection is the Plus Perfect Vintage Flare Jeans. Crafted with the brand's bestselling Heritage Stretch denim, these jeans are malleable and easy to break in. The vintage ‘90s style features a narrow waist that gently hugs the midsection and makes gaping a problem of the past. We love that the flare isn’t too bold either – it’s only slightly wider than a bootcut hem.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Madewell adds an additional two inches to the inseam for plus-sizes. This provides additional support for areas including the stomach and thighs. However, because of its popularity many sizes frequently sell out. We recommend turning on restock notifications to get an alert when your size is available.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range: </strong>14W—28W<strong> </strong>| <strong>Rise: </strong>High<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-waisted-good-american-good-curve-straight-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Waisted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Good Curve Straight</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Good Curve Straight Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TL-Gtrah3iZALOYRSS2Td9feevQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Good-American-Good-Curve-Straight-Jean-ef8d80cc2f654afa9787a09ab2b20662.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These jeans are made with a comfortable, stretchy fabric that hugs your curves.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The smaller sizes are rarely in stock.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a pair of high-waisted jeans that will look amazing from every angle, these jeans from Good American are Smith’s go-to choice. “Good American really designs for every body type,” she says. “The Good Curve is a great option [for short torsos] as it has a high rise and a cropped leg, which creates a nice shape.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to the extra high rise, these pants elongate the torso and tuck in the tummy at the same time. We compare the stretchy, curve-hugging fabric to leggings — they’re incredibly cozy and emphasizes your best assets, if you know what we mean. Plus, the cropped cut means you can show off your favorite kicks, whether those are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>everyday sneakers</a> or show-stopping heels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Good American also has some of the most inclusive sizing, but the smaller sizes (between 00 to 6) tend to sell out.

Clocking in at just 30 bucks, these trendy pants sit low on the hips and feature a straight-leg silhouette. This combo makes the jeans ideal for people with short torsos since they draw attention to the legs. Additionally, if you pair them with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>form-fitting crop top</a>, you’ll be able to show off your abs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing we especially love about these pants is that they’re designed to have less gaping at the waist and extra room throughout the hips and thighs, so they’re <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>perfect for curvy figures</a>.

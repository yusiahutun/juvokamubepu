The extra-wide paddle surface offers the ideal tension needed for a super straight style, especially when using a flat iron or blow dryer. We also like how it's made with eco-friendly recycled materials and a no-slip rubber handle for a secure grip.

If your hair is thick, coarse, or frizzy, brushing through it without causing damage can be tough. In this guide, our haircare experts will help you understand what to look for when you're searching for the best brushes for your thick hair.</p><p><strong>1. Type of Bristle</strong></p><p>When picking the best brush for thick wavy hair, know the kind of bristles you need. Check if they match your hair type and length. For medium to thick hair, go for <a href=#><u>boar bristle hair brushes</u></a>, as they're dense and distribute product and natural oil well, smoothing the cuticle.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of the benefits of using boar bristles, our contributor Nate Masterson, a renowned hair expert, says, “These bristles help distribute sebum (the natural oil produced by our hair) evenly throughout our hair which can lead to an increase in shine. They also offer an effective solution for gently detangling your knots without causing breakage and tension which can weaken your hair. Finally, they can stimulate blood circulation on your scalp and can be used as a physical exfoliant for your scalp. “</p><p>. Nylon bristles work similarly but are stiffer, great for thick to coarse hair. A mix of boar and nylon, like in some brushes, gives you the best of both. On the other hand, ceramic bristle brushes are best for sensitive scalp, and they also distribute heat evenly while styling.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Brush Head</strong></p><p>The size of the brush head matters for thick hair. A large head, like in Paul Mitchell Pro Tools 427 Paddle Brush, helps distribute products evenly and provides a larger surface area for quick and easy styling. Meanwhile, smaller brush heads might struggle with thick hair.</p><p><strong>3. Handle Design</strong></p><p>Consider the handle design. Well-cushioned ergonomic handles are easy to grip and great for styling.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Consider Your Styling Routine</strong></p><p>Think about your routine. If you use a blow dryer a lot, choose a brush that handles heat well, like the Gimme Detangle Brush—it's heat-resistant.</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Nate Masterson, Hair Expert - <a href=#>Maple Holistics</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Taming thick hair is no walk in the park without the best hair brush for thick hair. It requires special care and management to prevent hair fall, restore the health of damaged hair, stimulate growth and improve overall hair health. High-quality brushes, such as the Paul Mitchell Pro Tools 427 Paddle Brush, not only prevent snagging but also enhance scalp circulation. Our top recommendations feature lightweight and wide-paddled brushes with ergonomic handles, ensuring easy styling. If you're a fan of blow-drying, opt for one that can handle the heat. Further, regular cleaning, preferably on a weekly basis, is crucial to preventing build-up. Whether it's a quick detangle or a salon-worthy style, the right brush is your thick hair's best companion.</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>Is a comb better for thick hair?</p><p>Combs are great for thick hair, especially wide-tooth ones. They help untangle knots without causing much damage or breakage.</p><p>Is it better to comb hair wet or dry?</p><p>It's better to comb hair when it's dry.

Boar bristle brushes work well for thick hair, distributing natural oils and keeping it smooth.</p><p>Can I use a round brush for styling thick hair?</p><p>Yes, a round brush is great for styling thick hair, especially for adding volume and shaping.</p><p>Can a hairbrush prevent hair damage in thick hair?</p><p>Yes, the right detangling brush with nylon or boar bristles can help prevent damage and keep your hair healthy.</p><p>Are there any natural or eco-friendly options for hair brushes for thick hair?</p><p>Yes. Look for brushes made with natural materials like bamboo or recycled materials for an eco-friendly option.</p><p>How often should I clean my hairbrush when dealing with thick hair?</p><p>To maintain the effectiveness and hygiene of your brush, make sure to clean it once a week, removing any accumulated hair and product build-up.</p><p>Are there specific techniques for brushing thick hair?</p><p>Take a paddle brush and divide your hair into sections.

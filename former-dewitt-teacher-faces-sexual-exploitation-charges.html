I realize that just because information can be shared, doesn’t mean it should be shared,” Peterson continues. “I just believe in this situation, regarding a former school employee, I should provide as much information as I can.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Please keep the victim&nbsp;that came forward and their family in your thoughts and prayers. This took such amazing courage,” Peterson says.</p><p>“This is never the type of information I want to share with you.&nbsp;I am ashamed, disappointed, and heartbroken that this happened on my watch over our amazing school district. I pray that nothing like this ever happens again here … or anywhere else.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, I hope that this allows those involved to begin to heal.”</p><p>Peterson says anyone with questions or comments may contact him “and I will do my best to respond.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46cqaKllWSzsL7MnqlmnJWstrXAjK2cmpuYmr9ussCcnKxlo5rFtq3LZpyxqJyktrWt06Kmp2WTna6zs8SsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./episode-24.html><span>←</span><span>EPISODE #24: Paradigms Lee Anderson, AEG (UK) Toby Leighton-pope, RCAs Nick Light and Greencop</span></a>

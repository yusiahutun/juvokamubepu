<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Rihanna rocks platinum blonde hair and crazy nails in colorful PUMA collab</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Rihanna first entered a partnership with PUMA a decade ago and has since created numerous collections with the clothing brand and now she’s back.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star worked with the brand consistently between 2014 and 2017. However, she then seemingly parted ways with them to focus on becoming a master of her own with her Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin brands, as well as her clothing and lingerie lines under the same name. However, last year, she teased she would be releasing more sets of kicks with the shoe giant after six years away. This is giving fans (including us here at Celebrity Tidbit) hope <a href=#>Rihanna</a> could do the same with her music.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-845524874-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ad-for-rihanna-s-latest-puma-collaboration-showcases-her-new-look>Ad for Rihanna’s latest PUMA collaboration showcases her new look</h2><p>In the new advert for her new release with PUMA, Rihanna can be seen wearing some colorful <a href=#>fashion</a>. Her outfit consists of a black T-shirt with the word Asphalt in hot pink and a purple puff jacket.</p><p>She accessorized with a silver chain necklace and a red ribbon atop her head.</p><p>Her makeup also compliments the look as it features a wash of hot pink eyeshadow and a bold deep purple to match her jacket.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Zendaya debuts ‘daring’ new hair at Paris Fashion Week as she’s reunited with Hunter Schafer</a></p><p>However, Rihanna’s hair and nails are the real stars of the show. Her hair was bobbed for the campaign shoot and contrasted with her very purple look as it was platinum blonde. Meanwhile, her nails, although not too bold of a color as they were white, the length has us questioning how she did anything with them. But, because it’s Rih Rih, she effortlessly pulls it off.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The commercial</a> shows Rihanna surrounded by her designs on other people’s feet. A tangle of limbs frames the celebrity’s face, with some sneakers even being pressed into her face. In other shots, she holds the model’s legs up against her body, so their feet are by her ears.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-some-fans-just-want-music>Some fans just want music</h2><p>In the comments under the PUMA ad featuring Rihanna, which was posted to <a href=#>TikTok</a>, some fans of the Work singer (affectionately called the Navy) were not impressed. Instead of being excited about the new line, they were asking where her ninth album was.</p><p>In case you’ve been living under a rock, Rihanna,35, hasn’t released a record since 2016’s ANTI and despite teasing ‘R9’ on and off, we are yet to hear any new material from her.</p><p>“We don’t want shoes. We want an ALBUM,” commented one person.</p><p>Another used her birth name in their demand: “WHEN’S THE ALBUM COMING ROBYN? [red heart and weary face emoji].”</p><p>A third said: “I’m not moved, I need an album” and added a crying face emoji.</p><p>However, others were quick to compliment the star’s look.</p><p>One wrote: “Mother looks good in every hairstyle [three heart eyes emojis].”</p><p>“Oh my god,” penned someone else who added a fire and star eyes emoji.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift lyrics and fashion choices are covered in astrology</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2V%2FcL7IoZinppFiv7CvyqxkqaSRqbavwcxmmaWnnpmybrTAoqlmmZ6ZeqS%2BwLOwZqaRnrm0ecinZJynnKS%2Fp8HLZqeupZFisLC4y5qZaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-e7e18ffe-afd5-11e9-aa15-bf9661c3808f-html.html><span>←</span><span>On that day he rode our Boat | Sports</span></a>

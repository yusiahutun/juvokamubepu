A business owner of a transportation company revealed that Taylor gave a whopping $100k in bonuses to truck drivers.</p><p>“She’s giving a sum of money that is life-changing for these people,” Shomotion owner Mike Scherkenbach <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Rolling Stone.</p><p>He continued: “A lot of these drivers are not homeowners, and a lump sum like this gives you the ability to put a down payment on a home. That’s what makes me really happy. That generosity is a game changer for these people.”</p><p>&nbsp;“There are a lot of very wealthy people who choose not to share a dime of it,” Mike added. “We work with all kinds of wealthy people, but this is not the norm.”</p><p>Taylor went the extra mile and included handwritten letters to her crew which Mike called “incredible” for members to be recognized in such a special way.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans praise her work ethic</h2><p>Taylor’s fans are full of praise for her huge generosity and many filled Twitter with their reactions.</p><p>“Notice how Taylor knows how to pay her workers their bonuses and residuals. Some big companies can’t do that!” another one said.</p><p>“Her team is a huge part of her success and she knows it,” another wrote. “She is a great businesswoman. Not huge fan of her art but her work ethics are unmatched.”</p><p>A third fan added: “Taylor Swift is a kind person. End of story.” Someone else said: “Taylor Swift is a blessing to the music industry.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taylor confirmed new tour dates</h2><p>It looks like Taylor is not quite ready to close the chapter of her popular Eras Tour as she announced fresh new North American dates for 2024.</p><p>“Turns out it’s NOT the end of an era,” she teased about next year’s music trek.</p><p>Taylor will perform in Miami, New Orleans, Indy, and Toronto in October and November next year with music guest Gracie Abrams.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2WBcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkpaGWmnqktMCnnqKml2K0pr%2FTrqmeZaSkerW71KtknKqVrHqiv4yfmKerXaW%2ForXSnmSwp6KgeqbAx6KaaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./glories-chinas-oldest-mosque-guangzhous-huaisheng-mosque-and-its-doubtful-origin-story.html><span>←</span><span>Opinion | The glories of Chinas oldest mosque, Guangzhous Huaisheng Mosque, and its doubtful o</span></a>

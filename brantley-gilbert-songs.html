There's some great music on that album, and 'G.R.I.T.S.' (Girls Raised in the South) is a big fan favorite. YouTube views of the lyric videos for this song surpass at least one of his official music videos.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Valory Music Co.</span></p>Valory Music Co.<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>4</span><h2>'My Kind of Crazy'</h2>From 'Halfway to Heaven' (2011)<p>There are a number of beautiful ballads on 'Halfway to Heaven,' but 'My Kind of Crazy' might be the most revealing of his love songs. Gilbert has a tough exterior, but he's not afraid to open his heart for his friends and fans to see. The dichotomy helps make him a very, very interesting artist.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Valory Music Co.</span></p>Valory Music Co.<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>3</span><h2>'You Don't Know Her Like I Do'</h2>From 'Halfway to Heaven' (2011)<p>On the other hand, Gilbert is pretty good at exposing his broken heart as well. 'You Don't Know Her Like I Do' was Gilbert's second No. 1 single and the second to go Gold for 500K digital copies sold. "You don't know we've been through / That girl's my best friend / And there's no way you're gonna help me / She's the only one who can," he sings, putting to words something so familiar, yet so often fouled up.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Valory Music Co.</span></p>Valory Music Co.<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>2</span><h2>'Country Must Be Country Wide'</h2>From 'Halfway to Heaven' (2011)<p>'Country Must Be Country Wide' was the perfect song to introduce Gilbert to mainstream audiences without sacrificing a sound his longtime fans learned to love. It's not as edgy as some songs he'd cut previously, yet he didn't suddenly go soft. The result was a No. 1 hit, Gold single and several New Artist of the Year nods. Of course, what truly makes this the No. 2 song is the story he tells, and his message.</p></li><li><figure class=img-tag><p><span class=visually-hidden>Valory Music Co.</span></p>Valory Music Co.<p>loading...</p></figure><span class=count>1</span><h2>'Kick It in the Sticks'</h2>From 'Halfway to Heaven' (2011)<p>While not the radio hit 'Country Must Be ... ' was, 'Kick It in the Sticks' is still Gilbert's signature song. In a way, it defines everything he's about as an artist. Watch him perform this song live and you'll understand why people are so loyal to this man. It's a great recording that manages to capture that difficult-to-grasp live show energy.</p></li></ul><h2>What Are Your Favorite Brantley Gilbert Songs?</h2><p>Many of Brantley Gilbert's best songs never made it to radio, while a few others made it to radio for a different artist.

The Georgia native moved to Nashville after high school to pursue country music, but was initially unsuccessful. He worked odd jobs and sang demos before scoring success as a songwriter, earning cuts from George Strait, Tracy Byrd and Marty Raybon. Currington released his self-titled debut album in 2003 and had a Top 10 hit with his debut single, "Walk a Little Straighter," which was inspired by his difficult relationship with his alcoholic stepfather. Currington scored his first No. 1 hit with "Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right" in 2005, and has gone on to place nine total No. 1 hits, including "Good Directions," "People Are Crazy" and "That's How Country Boys Roll." He released his most recent album, 'Summer Forever,' in 2015.</p><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> William Matthew Currington</li><li><strong>Birth Date:</strong> Nov. 19, 1973</li><li><strong>Top Songs:</strong> “People Are Crazy,” “We Are Tonight,” “Good Directions”</li><li><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Currington’s No. 1 hit “Good Directions” was co-written by a young songwriter named Luke Bryan.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmXqHyjtculsGabpae%2FqrrGraanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adore-delano-age-net-worth-boyfriend-html.html><span>←</span><span>Adore Delano Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Tour, Boyfriend</span></a>

"<strong>I have issues with it because I think it's a very selfish thing,</strong>" he said.

But you're not taking into consideration the other people within that environment, who might be a little bit triggered or find it offensive."</p><p id=eZG66tAUNkD data-wc=10><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Biggest daytime TV feuds: Duos who famously fell out</a></p><p id=e-w8TJgUw3 data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Good Morning Britain star confirms exit after 10 years – details</a></p><p id=e-h6vu47Cp9 data-wc=25>While there is no law against being naked in public, the City of London Corporation recently received about a dozen complaints over a naked sunbather.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEQdZil2hnE data-wc=17>Taking to Twitter, viewers were quick to react to Helen's nakedness, with one person branding it "unnecessary".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3c4dc7de2611-screenshot-2023-05-30-at-083143.png><p id=eLTj3XfywX8 data-wc=30>A second fan tweeted: "Why is there a naked blurry woman on ITV #GMB right now?

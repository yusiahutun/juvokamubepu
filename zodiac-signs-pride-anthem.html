They all bring their own defining tastes, interests, and personalities to the table, bashing stereotypes every step of the way. However, one thing that never fails to bring the community back together<strong>—</strong>is music. That’s why it’s high time that we discuss <a href=#>the LGBTQ+ anthem that captures each zodiac sign</a>, as it will allow us to analyze and appreciate these songs on a deeper and more profound level.</p><p>When we don’t know how to process or comprehend our emotions, music is there to help you heal. And because so much of LGBTQ+ culture centers on accepting one another for who we are—despite our differences—and celebrating love in all its many forms, it’s easy to understand why this community has produced and inspired so much artistic brilliance since the beginning of time. Each of the following songs capture something unique about the queer experience, as the layers and nuances involved are truly endless.</p><p>In honor of Pride Month—and the fact that astrology is so popular with the LGBTQ+ community—here’s the queer anthem that aligns with your energy the most, according to <a href=#>your sun sign</a>, <a href=#>moon sign,</a> and/or <a href=#>rising sign</a>:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Aries: Diana Ross – “I’m Coming Out”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/R-5305299-1576899189-9526.jpeg><p>When Diana Ross released her self-titled album Diana in 1980, little did she know that the second track would eventually become one of the most iconic LGBTQ+ anthems in history. “I’m Coming Out” is an Aries song through and through, as the core of the song is about breaking free from your fear of being seen as your true self. Coming out about one’s gender or sexuality can be a terrifying prospect, but Aries wants you to own your identity, so the people who will appreciate you can actually find you.</p><p>The time has come for me<br>To break out of the shell<br>I have to shout<br>That I am coming out</p><p>I’m coming out<br>I want the world to know<br>I got to let it show</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.5><h2>Taurus: Chaka Khan – “I’m Every Woman”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/R-494803-1419617683-2079.jpeg><p>Whether you’re singing along to the original song by Chaka Khan or the cover by Whitney Houston, you can’t help but feel empowered by your feminity and overwhelmed by your love for other femmes. Since Chaka Khan released “I’m Every Woman” as her debut solo single in 1978, she spoke to every queer person and woman—trans or otherwise—who deserves to love themselves and feel confident in a patriarchal world. Taurus is ruled by Venus, goddess of beauty and love, making this a Taurean message to its core.</p><p>Whatever you want, whatever you need<br>Anything you want done baby, I’ll do it naturally<br>‘Cause I’m every woman<br>It’s all in me, it’s all in me</p><p>I’m every woman<br>It’s all in me<br>Anything you want done baby<br>I do it naturally</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6><h2>Gemini: Sam Smith & Kim Petras – “Unholy”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/215120_1357841.png><p>On the surface, it’s not hard to see why “Unholy” would be the LGBTQ+ anthem for chatty and sassy Gemini. This song not only boomed on TikTok, but it’s a duet between Sam Smith & Kim Petras. Gemini is the zodiac sign of the twins, which is exemplified by having two separate perspectives within the song. Plus, the boundary-pushing lyrics are all about being the side piece for a wealthy married man who hides his true sexuality from his wife. Gemini is always willing to entertain your double life and will never judge you for whatever you choose to keep hush-hush. However, that doesn’t mean they won’t call your ass out and write a song about it.</p><p>A lucky, lucky girl<br>She got married to a boy like you<br>She’d kick you out if she ever, ever knew<br>‘Bout all the $%^& you tell me that you do<br>Dirty, dirty boy<br>You know everyone is talking on the scene<br>I hear them whispering ’bout the places that you’ve been<br>And how you don’t know how to keep your business clean</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5><h2>Cancer: Christina Aguilera – “Beautiful”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MV5BNWQ4NTZiODYtNWIxMy00NThkLTljMTMtYjk0NTBlZTI4N2VhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk1NTMyNzM@._V1_.jpg><p>Christina Aquilera’s monumental tearjerker “Beautiful” resonates with any Cancer. These big-hearted souls find something to love in everyone, knowing that we are all wonderful, worthy and necessary, regardless of how harshly others may judge us and project their own fear onto us. The music video included a gay couple and a transgender person when it was released in 2002, resulting in a GLAAD Media Award. Plus, who could forget that iconic scene from Mean Girls in which “too gay to function” Damien aggressively sings this song at the talent show?</p><p>You are beautiful no matter what they say<br>Words can’t bring you down, no, no<br>Cause you are beautiful in every single way<br>Yes words can’t bring you down. Oh, no<br>So don’t you bring me down today</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.5><h2>Leo: Madonna – “Vogue”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault.jpeg><p>Leo is ruled by the vibrant and dazzling sun, prizing confidence, creativity, and self-expression. Leo shines with the same sparkle and warmth, which is why they want to be seen in all their glory. In Madonna’s seminal “Vogue” (1990), she speaks to every member of the LGBTQ+ community and commands them to cure the blues by getting up and dancing. Afterall, the dance floor represents total freedom and liberation! And let’s be real, Madonna—a legendary ally to the queer community—is also the biggest Leo who has ever lived.</p><p>Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache<br>It’s everywhere that you go (look around)<br>You try everything you can to escape<br>The pain of life that you know (life that you know)<br>When all else fails and you long to be<br>Something better than you are today<br>I know a place where you can get away<br>It’s called a dance floor<br>And here’s what it’s for, so</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5><h2>Virgo: Kylie Minogue – “Padam Padam”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/s-l1600.jpeg><p>If you’ve been to gay clubs recently, you’ve probably heard Kylie Minogue’s latest single “Padam Padam,” which always gets the dance floor feeling hot, heavy, and coquettish. It captures the way a Mercury-ruled Virgo’s attraction is subtle and analytical, but incredibly intense behind their shy veneer. “Padam Padam” gives confidence to every Virgo with a crush, who may be overthinking every move and paying too much attention to their quickening heart rate.</p><p>This place is crowding up<br>I think it’s time for you to take me out this club<br>And we don’t need to use our words<br>Wanna see what’s underneath that T-shirt<br>Shivers and cold champagne<br>I got the shivers every time you say my name<br>And I can tell that you’re all in (all in)<br>‘Cause I can hear your heart beating (padam)<br>‘Cause I can hear your heart beating (padam)</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=10.142783505155><h2>Libra: Lil Nas X – “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/montero.webp><p>This sexy song may get you moving at the club, but it’s hopelessly sentimental at its heart, which is so Libra. This song was inspired by the romantic drama film Call Me By Your Name, one of the first <a href=#>gay films Lil Nas X had ever seen</a>. In this LGBTQ+ anthem, he recalls his own challenging experience of loving a man who is not out yet. However, he still sees the beauty of “keeping the love between you two,” which is lighthearted in the Libra way. After all, Libra is associated with a love for one-on-one relationships, even if it only exists in private.</p><p>You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend<br>I’m not fazed, only here to sin<br>If Eve ain’t in your garden, you know that you can</p><p>Call me when you want, call me when you need<br>Call me in the morning, I’ll be on the way<br>Call me when you want, call me when you need<br>Call me out by your name, I’ll be on the way like</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Scorpio: Bronski Beat – “Smalltown Boy”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/R-163213-1171070151.jpeg><p>Scorpio is the zodiac sign of transformation; of blowing up your life and rebuilding a new one from the rubble. Coming out in an environment that is unaccepting of LGBTQ+ culture can mean leaving behind your entire life and starting over. Through melancholy eletronic beats that make you want to dance and cry at the same time, “Smalltown Boy” by Bronski Beat (1984) tells the story of a young man who has been disowned by his family for being gay. However, he still has faith that he will find the love he needs somewhere else, rising from the ashes like a phoenix.<br><br>You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case<br>Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face<br><br>Mother will never understand why you had to leave<br>But the answers you seek will never be found at home<br>The love that you need will never be found at home</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.5><h2>Sagittarius: Indigo Girls – “Closer to Fine”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/R-1053813-1468266338-4552.jpeg><p>Sagittarius is the zodiac sign of adventure, philosophy, and the hunger for new experiences that this fire sign is no stranger to. Not only is “Closer to Fine” by Indigo Girls (1989) the perfect sing-along for long car rides, but it also happens to be the be-all, end-all of lesbian anthems. Emily Saliers and Amy Ray’s folksy and sentimetal accoustic tune was featured in the unforgettable road trip episode of The L Word, where it has woven itself into the LGBTQ+ tapestry ’til the end of time.</p><p>And I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains<br>I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains<br>There’s more than one answer to these questions<br>Pointing me in a crooked line<br>And the less I seek my source for some definitive<br>(The less I seek my source)<br>Closer I am to fine, yeah<br>Closer I am to fine, yeah</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7><h2>Capricorn: RuPaul – “Supermodel”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ab67616d0000b2738a028c7d843777d17097b304.jpeg><p>If there’s one thing every Capricorn can agree on, it’s that success requires discipline and consistency, which is why you’ll never see one settling for anything less than being America’s Next Drag Superstar. RuPaul’s “Supermodel” (1992) is a call for precision and excellence, motivating and empowering you to get up and sashay, Shantay! This song has brought Drag Race to life, tapping into the brilliance and creativity that the LGBTQ+ community never fails to bring to the table.</p><p>Once upon a time, there was a little Black girl<br>In the Brewster projects of Detroit, Michigan<br>At 15, she was spotted by an Ebony Fashion Fair talent scout<br>And her modeling career took off (you better work!)<br><br>You better work (cover girl!)<br>Work it, girl (give a twirl!)<br>Do your thing on the runway<br>Work (supermodel!)<br>You better work it, girl (of the world!)<br>Wet your lips and make love to the camera</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.2276536312849><h2>Aquarius: Lady Gaga – “Born This Way”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BornThisWay-Single.webp><p>If any zodiac sign prides itself on being authentic and true to oneself, it’s Aquarius. This innovative and independent air sign is terrified of being “normal” and conforming, which is why Lady Gaga’s bop “Born This Way” (2011) is Aquarian through and through. This is the same woman who, when asked <a href=#>whether she “had a penis,”</a> said: “Maybe I do. Would it be so terrible?”.</p><p>I’m beautiful in my way ’cause God makes no mistakes<br>I’m on the right track, baby, I was born this way<br>Don’t hide yourself in regret, just love yourself, and you’re set<br>I’m on the right track, baby, I was born this way (born this way)</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.5><h2>Pisces: Fred Again & The Blessed Madonna – “Marea (we’ve lost dancing)”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/artworks-eoBQ7SlFtgeC-0-t500x500.jpeg><p>The dancefloor is a sacred place to the LGBTQ+ community, as the clubs are where they have always been able to congregate, release the stress of daily life, and let down their guard. And when the clubs were shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic, it hit the LGBTQ+ community both financially and emotionally. Pisces is the last sign in the zodiac, which is why it’s often associated with endings and loss. Pisces has deep, unwavering empathy, as well as a desire to transmute their emotions through creativity, capturing the vibe of Fred Again & The Blessed Madonna’s deep house deep dive. “Marea (we’ve lost dancing)” reminds us to remember all that we’ve lost, but not without pointing us toward hope for a better tomorrow.</p><p>This year we’ve had to lose<br>Our space (we’ve lost dancing)</p><p>We’ve lost hugs with friends<br>And people that we loved<br>All thеse things that we took for granted (wе’ve lost dancing)<br>If I can live through (we’ve lost dancing) this next six months (we’ve lost dancing)<br>Day by day (we’ve lost dancing)<br>If I can live through this (we’ve lost dancing)<br>What comes next<br>Will be<br>Marvelous</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xpqjpZ2irny7u8OimJxlo560r7%2BMqaminJVirq%2FAx56kaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-winlevi-for-hormonal-acne-clascoterone.html><span>←</span><span>Winlevi New Hormonal Acne Medication FDA</span></a>

His birth sign is Virgo. As per nationality, Vanity is an American and belongs to white ethnicity.</p><p>What’s more, Vanity has a half-sister and his parents are from Puerto Rico. Nevertheless, his family’s financial status was not too good, hence he grew up in a house trailer. At the early age, Vanity moved to Florida with his family in the hope of improving their prospects.</p><p>Furthermore, Vanity nurtured the love for music since his childhood and always dream to make it big in the entertainment industry. However, his parents who have mixed opinions about their child’s musical achievements later supported him to pursue a career in music.</p><h3>Career</h3><p>At the age of twenty-three, Vanity started his first music project, Love the Fashion (now Blood on the Dance Floor), with two friends: <strong>Christopher Mongillo</strong> and <strong>Rebecca Fugate</strong>. The trio worked hard to give their best and came up with their maiden album Lets Start a Riot. But the album failed to catch the imagination of the masses.</p><p>Further, the band started to record their second album It’s Hard to be a Diamond in a Rhinestone World. Later the band parted ways as Fugate and Mongilio were unable to participate in the tours held in Orlando.</p><p>During the tour, Vanity met <strong>Garret Ecstasy</strong> and soon collaborated with him to produce a few musicals. But it did not take much to replace Garret Ecstasy and welcome <strong>Jayy Von Monroe</strong> along with<strong> Matt M</strong>. But then again, the trio became a duo after Matty left the group.</p><p>Then after, the two started performing and presented many hit albums including 2009 Epic. Also, they toured through America after the album topped fifth in the Billboard chart.</p><p>Additionally, they worked together with a number of artists for their fourth album All the Rage. &nbsp;The album was released in June 2011 which went to be a triumph and as a note of thanks, the band released songs for free through an app on the social networking site Facebook.</p><p>In June 2012, the band released next album, Evolution, and EP, The Anthem of the Outcast, later four months. Adding up, Fallon Vendetta&nbsp;joined Blood on the Dance Floor, in May 2017.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong>&nbsp;<a class=yoast-link-suggestion__value href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Candace Rice Net Worth, Bio, Boyfriend, Age, Height and Teeth</a></p><h2>Dahvie Vanity’s Girlfriend and Wife</h2><p>People are still muddled and curious if Dahvie Vanity and Jay Von Monroe are actually dating or not.

The band – originally formed by friends Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Dick Taylor and Ian Stewart – has seen a small but significant turnover of members over the years, with just two founding members left in the fold today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Richest reports that the band is now worth over US$1.45 billion, so who is the richest Stone?</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">4 ways Kylie Jenner loves spoiling her daughter Stormi</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">7. Mick Taylor – US$300,000</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brought into the group in 1969 following the sidelining of Brian Jones, virtuosic six-string-slinger Mick Taylor was barely out of his teens when he joined the Stones at the start of their creative peak, making key contributions to its most critically acclaimed albums “Sticky Fingers” and “Exile on Main Street”, before leaving somewhat acrimoniously in 1974. He was paid performing royalties until 1982 when his contract expired, according to reports.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, he has pursued a solo career. In 2009, Taylor announced that he was nearly broke and reportedly planned to sue the band over unpaid royalties. But that never transpired, and instead Taylor, now 73, was brought back ceremoniously as a touring guest star on the 50 & Counting tour of 2012-13.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">6.

Shortly afterwards he drowned in his own swimming pool, at age 27, becoming one of the eerie first members of what became known as “The 27 Club” of young celebrity deaths (alongside Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse and others). As he didn’t have much time to accrue wealth, Celebrity Net Worth reports that his estate was about US$10 million.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Inside Kim Kardashian’s extravagant US$3.8 million car collection</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">5.

As an almost-founding member who auditioned in late 1962, he still gets royalty shares every time a Rolling Stones album is bought, streamed or downloaded. Perhaps why he’s never expressed much remorse for stepping away from the spotlight, which relieved “a lot of pressure”, as he told The Telegraph.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He’s written, recorded and performed music with his own group, Bill Wyman’s Rhythm Kings, as well as published several books about his time with the Stones. However, he would have no doubt have multiplied his US$80 million fortune – as Celebrity Net Worth estimates – several times if he’d stuck around for the band’s high-paying tours of recent years. As the “new guy” proves …</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">4.

Despite that, he’s still had time to clock a net worth of US$200 million, largely from The Rolling Stones’ mammoth tours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/19/233cb1d9-5173-4692-bd6a-7df0b6db5fcc_a2c2cbd8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before he got the call up, he was a member of rock bands The Faces and the Jeff Beck Group, while today Wood, 74, is also somewhat famous as a visual artist. Trained at Ealing Art College, he is the co-owner of the Scream London gallery and has sold hundreds of works, including paintings, sculptures and etchings – including many of his famous band mates.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How Shark Tank billionaire Mark Cuban is changing the world</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">3.

At the time of his death, Watts’ fortune was estimated to be around US$250 million, mostly through his ownership of shares in the corporate entities of The Rolling Stones, per Celebrity Net Worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/19/3b0398de-277c-47ec-b47a-5ea081af59f9_84164b84.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was also a horseman behind the stage. With his wife Shirley, he owned a Polish Arabian horse farm, Halsdon Arabians at Dolton in Devon, England. At one point, their herd numbered more than 250 horses, per Horse Talk.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><br><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2. Keith Richards – US$500 million</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/19/742599fc-0789-4984-ae36-07f30e5d0326_2e884af5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The band’s unmistakable guitarist, vocalist, co-songwriter and “Human Riff” is sitting on a mountain of cash built from his 60-year contribution to music. Obviously, most of Richards’ half-a-billion net worth comes from the band he continues to define – for not just writing the unmistakable guitar hooks that drive Start Me Up, Gimme Shelter, Brown Sugar, et al, but dutifully trotting them out night after night for 50-odd years and counting. Besides Mick, there’s really no other member the band could continue to credibly function without.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 78-year-old artist has dabbled in producing with his own record label Mindless Records, and worked with many historical artists like Aretha Franklin and Ronnie Spector.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/19/a5bea10b-c5c3-4633-9007-8bcb302b4ceb_99ba3787.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additionally, he also made a foray in the film and book world. He played the role of Jack Sparrow’s dad Captain Edward Teague in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End – after Johnny Depp famously confessed he based his own character on Richards’ mischievous piratic presence – and a cameo in The Simpsons. Meanwhile, his memoir Life, published in 2010, sold over one million copies within its first year, becoming one of the bestselling rock autobiographies ever. In 2014, he published a children’s book about how his grandfather inspired him to learn guitar: Gus & Me: The Story of My Granddad and My First Guitar.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1.

Like Lennon-McCartney before them, (nearly) all The Rolling Stones catalogue is co-credited to Jagger-Richards, and the lead singer has earned just as much as his childhood friend over the years.<br></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Besides music, he also has a career in the film industry, starring in cult favourites Performance (1968) and Ned Kelly (1970), among others. He owns US$250 million in real estate around the world, including mansions in New York and London, a castle in the south of France, and an estate on the private Caribbean island of Mustique. But when you’re the face of the world’s most iconic rock band, we say that makes you worth it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxocGlga4Zww8eoqmaqmZi1pr%2FTZqmopJyeu6h50q2mp52jYrqmucGeqWasmJq2s3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwam%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./united-states-coast-guard-hosts-mission-mighty-mississippi-family-friendly-event.html><span>←</span><span>United States Coast Guard hosts Mission Mighty Mississippi family-friendly event</span></a>

"I was so excited to get them," Muthart said (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a>) after the procedure. "I just wanted to appear more normal to the outside world."</p><p>The photo above shows Kaylee after the incident, while the images below show her with her new prosthetics.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/07/4by3/2020/08/11/07125cac93fb4211998c8cad8630b1f0_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">SWNS</span><p>While her 42-year-old boyfriend Alex George said he never looked at her differently, he added it "melted my heart" to see her after he saw her with the prosthetics.</p><p>"I know she's wanted this for a very long time and I'm so happy she has this now," he added. "She is always an upbeat and positive person, but this made her extra happy. It was incredible to be able to look in her eyes."</p><p>The two reportedly celebrated with a dinner at Applebees, where they also had their first date.</p><p>Since the 2018 incident, Muthart entered rehab and has been focusing on her sobriety. She's currently enrolled in a school for the blind and is working on getting her high school diploma.</p><p>During her Dr. Oz appearance, Muthart said she could recall the psychotic event and said it was "really painful." In a hard-to-watch clip, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she also showed what it looked like behind her eyelids</a>, saying she still had muscle movement.</p><p>She also said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">life was more beautiful for her after the incident</a>, because she'd "rather be who I am today with the mindset I have now" than who she was before.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7j3FmamlfoK66uMSeZKatpJ2us8CMqamoq6SdsrW1wmacsp2jZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-access-and-use-ps-now-on-your-pc.html><span>←</span><span>How to Access and Use PlayStation Plus on Your PC</span></a>

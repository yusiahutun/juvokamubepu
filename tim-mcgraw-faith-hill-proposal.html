"Indian Outlaw" came during a four-song encore, while "Diamond Rings and Old Bar Stools" came early. In between were some of the biggest hits of the '90s and early '00s, and several from his most recent Sundown Heaven Town album. "Shotgun Rider" was an early highlight. The song emerged from a smoky introduction and ended with fans singing along to every word. Of the more subdued songs it was topped by only "Just to See You Smile."</p><p>Early on Mr. Faith Hill told the story of his engagement, which took place 20 years earlier at Country Jam. He then attempted to get fans to wish Hill a sort of Happy Anniversary on the phone, but after being unable to get her on the line, he defaulted to a recorded message.</p><p>The show barely slowed for the personal moment. "Real Good Man," "Unbroken" and "Felt Good on My Lips" were a few of the uptempo songs that got fans to their feet. McGraw proved that age hasn't caught up to him several times. Honestly, how many 48-year-old men do you see jumping on the speakers and hopping up and down like a teenager? There may only be one.</p><p>The star even entered the crowd for "I Like It, I Love It" before emerging for the tender "The Cowboy in Me." It was an odd song to close his show with, and it all but insured he'd return for an encore.</p><p>As he's done much of the summer, McGraw began his final bow with <a href=#>Elton John</a>'s "Tiny Dancer," giving a slightly better version than he did one week ago at the Taste of Country Music Festival in New York. Screams echoed between the mountains of Grand Junction when he showed his eight-pack abs during "Indian Outlaw," but the show's signature moment was his final song. "Live Like You Were Dying" feels as personal today as it did when he released it in 2004. The singer let the fans take the first chorus, and they didn't let him down. In fact, he seemed in awe of the response.</p><p>McGraw — who left the stage to return to Vancouver to continue shooting The Shack&nbsp;— closed Day 3 of Country Jam 2015. <a href=#>Kacey Musgraves</a>, <a href=#>Billy Currington</a> and <a href=#>Colt Ford</a> were amongst the day's earlier performers. <a href=#>Toby Keith</a> will headline the fourth and final night of the four-day camping and country music festival.</p><p><strong>Tim McGraw Talks New Movie 'The Shack'</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmraGdYrqks9GarmaekZ7BqXnHoqOlZaCnvLG70pqjaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robbie-williams-eye-watering-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Robbie Williams eye-watering net worth compared to other Take That members</span></a>

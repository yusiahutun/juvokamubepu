Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen!” he tells Phoebe on his return to the Big Apple.</p><p>The Abbey, one of the UKs most important and iconic buildings, has stood since 1066, and costs £18 per person to enter.</p><p>On your way out, check out Big Ben and The Houses of Parliament too.</p><p><b>Trinity Place, Poplar</b></p><p>You may not find Sir Richard Branson selling Union Jack hats, but you can take a gander at the stalls lining the Thames to pick up your own London souvenir.</p><p>In the episode, Richard, making a cameo appearance, said: “So, what are you fine gentlemen in the market for? Scarves? Souvenir postcards?”</p><p>Joey picks up the novelty hat and tries it on, asking Chandler what he thinks, to which he responds: “Well, I’m not going to have to buy that I’m with stupid t-shirt anymore.”</p><p><b>Tower Bridge</b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24620082.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_London-Tower-Bridge-across-the-River-Thames.jpg><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24616128><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="New prison themed bar where punters are jailmates- you have to sneak booze in" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24616128><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24616176.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_5Z6A8815-optimised.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24616176.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_5Z6A8815-optimised.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24616128>New prison themed bar where punters are jailmates- you have to sneak booze in</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p>Only briefly appearing in the episode is Tower Bridge, whilst Chandler and Joey ride the open-top bus.</p><p>Buy a ticket to the hop-on hop-off tour from City Sightseeing for £29, and it’ll be one of the easiest ways to see London’s iconic landmarks in the same way Joey did, seeing as Chandler fell asleep…</p><p>Built between 1886 and 1894, you can also do a tour of Tower Bridge for just £10.60.</p><p><b>Buckingham Palace</b></p><p>Buckingham Palace is fleetingly seen on some of the b-roll that Joey filmed on his camcorder.

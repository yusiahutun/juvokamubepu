Keep reading to learn more about who Raul Conde is and what happened between him and Mena.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/raulll.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_King_Condes_Father></span>Who Is King Conde’s Father?&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>King Conde’s father is Raul Conde.

In 2011, he was involved in a controversy with his former girlfriend, Erica Mena, that escalated to the point of her assaulting him on the streets.&nbsp;</p><p>Mena had accused him of abusive behavior in the past and would eventually end the relationship even though it meant making parenting their only child more difficult.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_Between_Raul_Conde_and_Erica_Mena></span>What Happened Between Raul Conde and Erica Mena?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Their relationship became more intense after Mena got pregnant with their first child, King Conde, at age 19. But she quickly learned he was not the best parent or lover then.&nbsp;</p><p>Mena was very vocal about it. She would call him out for being a terrible father and partner in interviews, but it was worse. He was also abusive, and violence plagued their relationship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mena-fotor-20231107114440.jpg><p>Conde reportedly abused her excessively while their on-again-off-again relationship played out. Fans of the famous TV personality saw first-hand how turbulent the bond between her and Conde was when their love life was showcased in one of the episodes of “Love and Hip Hop: New York.”&nbsp;</p><p>The episode about Conde and Mena captured a fierce argument between them on the streets of Miami, and she was even seen getting physical with him. Later, Mena apologized for her actions, feeling ashamed of her outburst and how it could affect their child.</p><p>She ultimately chose to end the relationship, after which she moved on with rapper Bow Wow. More recently, reports claim that Mena and her baby daddy have gotten past their differences and are trying to stay cordial for the sake of their child.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Erica-Menas-ex-partner-600x400-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Much_Is_Raul_Conde_Worth></span>How Much Is Raul Conde Worth?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Conde has made some very crucial contributions to the rise of the hip-hop label, and this has left him a wealthy man.

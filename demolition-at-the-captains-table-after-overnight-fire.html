It just wasn’t safe to do that.”</p><p>For much of the late night and early morning fight, the concern for crews wasn’t just for the danger of fire but also ice.</p><p>“From that initial report until about 3 a.m., we wanted to limit.”&nbsp;Snyder said, “We were concerned about exposure, frostbite issues, so we were working in about a 15 to 20-minute range and then trying to rotate when we could.”</p><p>Snyder says that was made easier with crews from East Moline and the Rock Island Arsenal Fire Departments providing assistance&nbsp;and a MetroLink bus was even there to provide some shelter from the elements.<br>But it’s not just the people left freezing in the cold.</p><p>Snyder said, “One fire truck on the scene that’s been here the whole time, so we’re to have to face those issues of trying to get it unfrozen from the ground and the fire hydrant.”</p><p><strong>EARLIER UPDATE</strong></p><p>River Drive in Moline has reopened to traffic.</p><p><strong>EARLIER UPDATE</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;Captain’s Table in Moline is being torn down after the overnight fire.</p><p><strong>EARLIER UPDATE</strong></p><p>River Drive in Moline will be closed until late this afternoon due to the fire at the Captain’s Table. Traffic is being rerouted at 41st Street and 55th Street.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EARLIER STORY</strong></p><p>The Captain’s Table on River Dr. in Moline went up in flames overnight Monday into Tuesday morning. Crews are still working in the frigid temperatures to battle the blaze early Tuesday morning.</p><p>According to the restaurant’s Facebook page, this comes hours after they&nbsp;announced&nbsp;parts of the building had just been remodeled&nbsp;and the bar was almost complete. Workers say they were excited to share the remodeling additions which employees had done almost by themselves.</p><p>The Captain’s Table also released a statement saying, “We are devastated. Our family has lost our home and our job for now. We are absolutely devastated by the tragedy that has happened tonight. We want to let our friends, family & concerned customers know that everyone is safe. Thank you everyone for your concern and support.”<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46dnKannJ7BqrvNZpitZaSdsm6vwKmrmqGeqHq1rcGlnGaZlqmys3nOr5yrppmctbV5xaKpnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-the-guest-stars-on-evil-so-far.html><span>←</span><span>All The Guest Stars On Evil, So Far</span></a>

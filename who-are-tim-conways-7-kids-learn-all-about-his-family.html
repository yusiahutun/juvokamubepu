Although this news might make you feel really sad, just know that he’s survived by his five sons, Corey, Jaime, Pat, Shawn and Tim Jr., and his two daughters, Kelly and Jackie. Plus, with such a big family and an amazing fan base, Tim will never be forgotten.</p><p>As a Hollywood heartthrob, Tim has been married two times. He first tied the knot in 1961 with <strong>Mary Anne Dalton</strong>, and they later got divorced in 1978. After they separated, he wed <strong>Charlene Conway</strong> in 1984 and they have been together ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-454939864.jpg><p>Although Tim shares all of his kids with his first wife, he never let it cripple his relationship with Charlene. The couple was still able to make it work even though they never had a baby together. “I have seven children, two grandchildren and a puppy. I have been married since 1984, a record for Hollywood. I do not have a serious thought in my head,” <a href=#>Tim joked on his website.</a></p><p><a href=#>The Carol Burnett Show</a> star added, “My ambition was to be a jockey, but at my weight, even the horses were asking me to get off.” Tim went on to become a famous actor who took Hollywood by storm. During his career, he won six Emmys and a Golden Globe award. But when he wasn’t in the studio working on his next big act, he was with his family doing what he loved the most.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tim-conway.jpg><p>“He’s been on cruises with his wife, throws barbecues when his kids visit, watches horseracing and goes out to the track when he’s in the mood,” a source previously told the <a href=#>National Enquirer about Tim’s hobbies.</a> What a guy!</p><p>We’ll always remember you, Tim!</p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlkaeybsDIpmScp56srrq%2FjHBkpKGUqHqtscCrpWaZnKF6oq7OrqtmoJmoeqetzKKjsmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-psychology-behind-self-motivation.html><span>←</span><span>The psychology behind self-motivation</span></a>

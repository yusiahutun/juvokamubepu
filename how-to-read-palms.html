Palm reading, also referred to as Chiromancy or "cheiromancy," is one method that has existed in various forms and has been used in cultures around the globe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Palmistry is an ancient, embodied, and empowering art intended for curious minds to inspire self-reflection and, when used with others, human connection," explained Helene Saucedo, palm reader and author of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Handful of Stars: A Palmistry Guidebook and Hand-Printing Kit</a>. "The markings on our hands hold information on our personalities — our emotional, mental, and spiritual worlds."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a guide on how to get started with palm reading.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-brief-history-of-palm-reading></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Brief History of Palm Reading</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Palmistry or palm reading dates back to India, likely between 4000 and 1000 CBE, explained Saucedo. It also is thought to have had roots in China and the Middle East, specifically Egypt. In the late Victorian era, Irish astrologer, clairvoyant, and palmist William John Warner (aka Cheiro) made quite the impression in the field. He read the palms of historical icons like Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, Thomas Edison, and Sarah Bernhardt.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-read-palms></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Read Palms</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Look at Dominant and Non-Dominant Hands</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kaitlyn Collins/InStyle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your dominant hand represents who you are — your personality, where you are in your life, where you've been, and where you're going — in the present moment. Your non-dominant hand represents your potential and aspiration.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Consider the Hand Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The shape of your hands reflects one of the four elements: water, fire, air, or earth. You can determine which by looking at the proportion of the palm to the fingers. Note that your dominant hand could be one element, while your non-dominant could be another. The elements might but won't necessarily mirror the signs in your birth chart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Water Hands: </strong>With long palms and long fingers, these individuals tend to be more intuitive, creative, sensitive, empathic, and emotional, explains Saucedo. Think: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>water signs</a> like Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Fire Hands: </strong>Featuring long palms and shorter fingers, this shape indicates someone restless, anxious, warm, and action-oriented. The shape is associated with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fire signs</a> Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Air Hands: </strong>With square palms and long fingers, the air shape indicates an intellectual, curious, adaptable, and cerebral personality type. Think of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>air signs</a> like Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Earth Hands: </strong>This type sports square palms and short fingers and is hardworking, logical, pragmatic, and grounded. These traits are in line with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>earth signs</a> Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-observe-the-mounts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Observe the Mounts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fleshy areas of the palm, referred to as "mounts," speak to individual talents and gifts that could be prominent for you during this lifetime. There are seven main ones, each associated with planets that we also use in astrology:</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kaitlyn Collins/InStyle</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Apollo (the sun): </strong>The artist, creative</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Luna (the moon)</strong>: The visionary, intuition</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Mercury: </strong>The communicator, communication<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><strong>Venus</strong></a>: The lover, pleasure</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mars</a>: </strong>The warrior, resilience</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Jupiter: </strong>The leader, ambition</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Saturn: </strong>The scholar, discipline</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Check Out Your Fingerprints</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Saucedo noted she looks at fingerprints to offer insight into a person's life purpose.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Certain markers will point to the avenues where you will feel best when your energy is used in that way," she explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fingerprints are identified using the same labels as forensic science. They correspond with the archetypes of the fingers the print lives on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pointer finger:</strong> Jupiter</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Middle finger: </strong>Saturn</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Ring finger:</strong> Apollo</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pinky finger: </strong>Mercury</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Loop:</strong> Intuitive, imaginative (Water)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Whorl:</strong> Independent, individualist (Air)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Arch:</strong> Stable, reliable (Earth)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Tented Arch: </strong>Enthusiastic, wise (Fire)</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Look at the Lines</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When we hear about palm reading, the life line is usually the first thing we think of, but there are actually three main lines to check out — and many other minor lines that can offer valuable info.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The lines on our palms reflect the roads we take on the journey of personal growth," said Saucedo.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Palm readers consider depth, length, and curves of your lines to make observations about those roads. Here are the main lines:</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>KAITLYN COLLINS/INSTYLE</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Your head line:&nbsp;</strong>Denoting your intellectual energy, this line — located in the center of the palm — also speaks to lessons that might come up for you in this lifetime. Its angle also speaks to your mentality.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The more angled it is, the more open, adaptable, and intuitive you are," explained Saucedo. "The more straight it is, the more rigid your thinking."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Your heart line:&nbsp;</strong>Located above the head line is your heart line, which speaks to your emotional self and how you interact in your life emotionally. A dramatically swooping shape indicates a nurturing emotional personality, a straight line is more stoic, and a softer "smile" or U-shape indicates emotional balance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Your life line:&nbsp;</strong>A common misconception about palmistry is that your life line tells you when you're going to die.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The lifeline is more about your vitality," explained Saucedo. "It's how much energy you have and how good you feel about your life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_91-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "If it's short, that can mean that you don't have a clear vision of what you want, you're working too much, or maybe you're a little depressed."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Saucedo also emphasized the importance of ethics in palm reading — namely that even professionals should avoid topics like death and illness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_97-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Your stability line:&nbsp;</strong>This line comes up the center of the hand and speaks to stability in terms of career, paying your bills, and feeling safe in the world. Looking at not only its depth and length but also where it originates can tell a story. For instance, if it originates from the left side of your hand — the mount of luna — your security could be built from creative work.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-putting-it-all-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_99-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Putting It All Together</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_100-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The permanence of the shapes and lines on your hands might feel a bit freaky, as though palmistry is at odds with free will. However, Saucedo suggested that's not the case, telling&nbsp;InStyle&nbsp;that although our fingerprints never change — which is why they're used for forensics — our hands change as we change.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_104-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For instance, she had a client whose hand she read in 2020, and then she did the Appalachian Trail. She came to Saucedo and wanted to see if her hands changed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_106-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They had," she recalled. "It was fascinating."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_108-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the awareness you gather when reading your palms, you'll gain more power in creating your destiny.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8eormasn2K%2Fpq3DZqeapJ2o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-nobody-by-nas.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Nobody by Nas</span></a>

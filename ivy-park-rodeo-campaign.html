From her thoughtfully curated music performances and the intricate ensembles that go along with them, the mega star knows how to create a good storyline. The Lemonade era gave us peak Southern gothic while Black Is King centered on the idea of monarchy. Now, for her fifth highly coveted Ivy Park drop with Adidas, the singer is paying homage to her Houston roots by highlighting one of Texas’s most beloved pastimes: the rodeo.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the new <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a37269055/beyonce-inspiration-ivy-park-rodeo-collection/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=campaign class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">campaign</a> celebrating the launch, the star brought Black cowboy culture center stage with a ranch-themed shoot—complete with hay bail. Beyoncé personally picked more than a handful of prominent faces to model the new pieces, including emerging rapper Monaleo (who also calls the state home), model Paloma Elsesser, and singer Snoh Aalegra. But if you ask the members of the star-studded cast, being recruited to participate was nothing but an honor.</p><img alt="ivy park rodeo" title="ivy park rodeo" width=1067 height=1600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/b136aef6-0531-4434-be3e-b4bfe6c62c51-1629148100.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">courtesy of Ivy Park</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“To be recognized and handpicked by one of the greatest artists of all time is just very humbling and extremely flattering,” Aalegra tells BAZAAR.com. “I love [Beyonce’s] vision, her creative mind, and what she brings to the game. The way she layers deeper purpose in the choices she makes is something rare that I value a lot. I know this collection means a lot, as it ties back to her childhood growing up in Houston and going to the rodeo every year, describing it as a diverse and multicultural experience. For her to include me, as an Iranian woman in this campaign, was really cool.”</p><img alt="ivy park rodeo campaign" title="ivy park rodeo campaign" width=1600 height=1067 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/937a0486-1d6c-428b-b9a3-e1f461178e2f-1629146863.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Ivy Park</span><p>Snoh Aalegra</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The collection itself draws inspiration Beyonce's youthful memories of going to the rodeo with her mother Tina Knowles-Lawson and sister Solange. “My girls’ childhood consisted of every year going to the rodeo, dressing in full cowgirl regalia, and eating all the great foods, like giant turkey legs, fried Snickers, and cotton candy,” she explains to BAZAAR about the fanfare. “It was our circus. Carnival rides every night, and then, of course, the actual cow roping, trick horse riding (my favorite), culminating with a concert of the biggest artist at the time,” Knowles-Lawson continues, adding that the iconic Selena Quintanilla was one of their favorites.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Designed with lavender and brown cow prints, fringe, and great denim, the collection features more fashion-driven pieces in addition to its activewear offerings. The jeans included are made from rigid denim, with no stretch, to resemble traditional cowboy styles. “I love denim that has body,” Beyoncé’s mom divulges on the decision. “Adding the Adidas stripes is giving it a cool, new modern twist.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you’re ready to invite the new pieces into your wardrobe, they will be available in stores and online on Thursday, August 19.

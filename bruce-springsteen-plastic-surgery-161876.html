But every time he performs fans wonder one thing: has he gotten any <a href=#>plastic surgery </a>done? To answer that question, Closer Weekly exclusively chatted with experts (who’ve never worked with the music sensation) about what procedures Bruce may have gotten done over the years. And so it turns out, they all agree that it’s likely been nothing.</p><p>“Well, if you look closely, you don’t really see signs of plastic surgery. The wrinkles in his forehead are deeper, so no Botox. His eyelids and neck are heavier, so no eyelid or neck lift,” <a href=#>Dr. Andrew Miller</a> shared. “His face is overall thinner now, so he probably isn’t getting any fillers. The only thing I could possibly say is he may have had a small hair transplant — just something to keep his frontal hairline up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bruce-springsteen-plastic-surgery-2.jpg><p><a href=#>Dr. Adam H. Hamawy</a> added, “A close examination of Bruce Springsteen’s face doesn’t reveal any obvious signs of recent plastic surgery that can [I] see. But there’s a whole list of things that I would recommend.” And <a href=#>Dr. Vartan Mardirossian</a> agreed. “I don`t think he had anything done. He may benefit from upper and lower blepharoplasty along with some Botox. But again, it does not seem to me that he had anything done at this point.”</p><p>While Bruce has never publicly spoken out about any plastic surgery procedures, he’s been very vocal about his <a href=#>past battle with depression</a>. “I was crushed between 60 and 62, good for a year and out again from 63 to 64,” he admitted to <a href=# title=_self>Vanity Fair</a> in 2016. “Not a good record.” During that scary time, Bruce was afraid he’d end up like his dad, who battled mental health issues and alcoholism before his death. “You don’t know the illness’s parameters,” Bruce shared. “Can I get sick enough to where I become a lot more like my father than I thought I might?” We’re just glad Bruce is looking and feeling better today!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bqa6blWLAsb7Ip56srJWau268y5qqraGTYsC2vsaeqbJlYWt%2BeYOVaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./htg-explains-how-hdcp-breaks-your-hdtv-and-how-to-fix-it.html><span>←</span><span>Why HDCP Causes Errors on Your HDTV, and How to Fix It</span></a>

He was 40 years old. He was survived by his wife, Allison Holker, a contestant on So You Think You Can Dance season 2, and their three children: Weslie Fowler, Maddox Laurel and Zaia. Holker confirmed her husband’s death in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> on December 14, 2022. He was 40 years old. “It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to share my husband Stephen has left us,” Holker said in a statement. “Stephen lit up every room he stepped into. He valued family, friends and community above all else and leading with love and light was everything to him. He was the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.” She continued, “To say he left a legacy would be an understatement, and his positive impact will continue to be felt. I am certain there won’t be a day that goes by that we won’t honor his memory. We ask for privacy during this difficult time for myself and especially for our three children.” She ended her statement with a message to her husband. “Stephen, we love you, we miss you, and I will always save the last dance for you,” she said.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/twitch-kids.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/twitch-last-words.jpg><p><strong>If you or someone you know is struggling, help is available.

Law enforcement sources told the site that tWitch’s wife, Allison Holker, ran into a Los Angeles Police Department station on December 13, 2022, frantic because tWitch had left their house without his car, which wasn’t like him. At around 11:15 a.m. PT, paramedics received a call for a medical emergency at a Los Angeles hotel, where tWitch was found dead. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>Holker, who married tWitch on December 10, 2013, celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary three days before his death. “It’s our 9th anniversary!! I couldn’t be more grateful to celebrate this perfect magical day!!! Saying YES to @sir_twitch_alot has been one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life!! I feel so blessed and loved!! I love you baby and I will never take you or OUR love for granted!

Read on for what we know about tWitch’s wife and how they met before his sudden and tragic death.</p><h2>Who is tWitch’s wife?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Stephen-Twitch-Boss-Allison-Holker.jpg><p>Who is tWitch’s wife, Allison Holker? Like her husband was, Holker is also a professional dancer.&nbsp;In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> four months after the tragic death of her husband, she spoke about the strength her children have found in carrying on. “My kids and I always had such a strong unit, but at this time there is just a different bond that we share. I always want to make sure that they see me really strong for them, but it’s been amazing to see that my kids are also there for me now,” said Holker of her daughters Weslie, 14, Zaia, 3, and son Maddox, 7.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m so proud of them, and of how they’re willing to feel and communicate with me. They’re open to asking me questions, and we try to find our way together,” she continued. “Sometimes it breaks my heart that they have to feel that pressure to take care of me, but that’s a true testament to Stephen because that’s what he would have done.” Holker also said she saw the best parts of Stephen in their children. “Weslie is his wisdom, Maddox is his joy, and our youngest, Zaia, is his intuition,” she said. “They all have these really special, unique energies about them. They lean into it and they inspire me every single day.”</p><p>She was a contestant on So You Think You Can Dance season 2, where she came in eighth place. She returned as an all-star on So You Think You Can Dance for seasons 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 14. She was an all-star with tWitch on seasons 7, 8 and 9. Holker was also a professional dancer on Dancing With the Stars for seasons 19 where she was partnered with actor Jonathan Bennett; season 20 where she was partnered with R5 member Riker Lynch; season 21 where she was partnered with singer Andy Grammer; and season 23 where she was partnered with singer Babyface.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">HollywoodLife</a> in 2017, Holker explained what dance means to her. “Dance to me is my home,” she said. “I say dance is my home, because in a home, you want love, creativity, respect, all these things, and to me that’s everything that encompasses dance. So I feel at my best when I’m dancing. It helps me to be strong and to release so many of my emotions and be in tune with myself. I connect a lot with people. I find being a dancer that some of our strongest moments together are when we’re dancing together.” She continued, “As a pro on Dancing With the Stars or So You Think You Can Dance, I found some of my strongest relationships, because dance is a way of connecting and finding a moment with someone. It really is something special and unique that you don’t find in any other physical activity, you know? Because it’s you with another person, and you guys dive in together with these characters. So dance, to me, has been really special to create amazing bonds with people.”</p><p>She also revealed at the time whether she would come back to So You Think You Can Dance or Dancing With the Stars. “I’ll definitely be going back to those shows. I had a little bit of a crossover with some scheduling things for this summer, so I do have a couple of things coming up that are very, very exciting,” she said. “I can’t say what they are right now, but I start filming this next week, and I’m very excited about this new journey and this new project I’m working on. It’s very, very exciting. I’m nervous but excited. I love to challenge myself and try new things and push myself in new directions. Sometimes it’s the most nerve-wracking thing because you don’t really know what you’re doing because you’re new to it. But then you always learn the most those ways. I love trying new things, and so I’m going to be doing a new show, and it’s going to be an exciting new journey for us all.”</p><p>Alison Holker was announced as a judge on So You Think You Can Dance season 18. She says her two affirmations are&nbsp; “I’ll always show up,” and “I’m capable of it.” “I also tell myself that every season — whether it’s good or bad — has an expiration date,” she said in an essay. “And if you can just get past those hard moments, you’ll find yourself.”</p><h2>How did tWitch and Allison Holker meet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Twitch-Allison-Holker-2.jpg><p>How did tWitch and Allison Holker meet? tWitch and Holker met in 2006 when they were invited to a party hosted by their mutual friend, Ivan Koumaev, who was also a contestant on So You Think You Can Dance&nbsp;season 2 with Holker at the time. “We met there for the first time, but Allison doesn’t remember at all! Meanwhile, I had blond hair and piercings, so I’m not sure how you’d forget me, but that’s neither here nor there,” tWitch told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dance Spirit</a> in 2012.</p><p>Holker and tWitch, who was the runner-up on So You Think You Can Dance season 4, reconnected in 2010 when they were both all-stars on SYTYCD season 7. “<span>We met again during Season 7, but didn’t say a word to each other the whole season. So that’s why I had no idea, because she wouldn’t talk to me and I thought she wasn’t interested. She did catch me checking her out in the hallway once,” tWitch said. Holker, however, denied that she didn’t make a move on tWitch. “I didn’t just make one move—I made, like, 10 moves and he wasn’t seeing them, so I had to put myself out there even more. From the first week of So You Think You Can Dance as all-stars, I thought he was the cutest guy ever. His personality was so fun,” he said.</span></p><p>Their relationship didn’t turn romantic until August 2010 when they attended the premiere of Step-Up 3D, which tWitch starred in, in Los Angeles, and tWitch asked for Holker’s phone number.&nbsp;“The all-stars went to the Step Up 3D premiere, but Stephen went separately because he was in the movie. I looked down the red carpet and saw him standing there in this nice gray suit and glasses—he looked so hot,” Holker said. “When he walked up to say hi, I got embarrassed and hid behind Ade! Then, at the party, I met his mother and brother and even danced with him a little bit. I was geeking out. That was the first night we were out together at the same place. So I finally made my move, and he asked for my number.”</p><p>Though they exchanged numbers, it wasn’t until the So You Think You Can Dance wrap party that either made a move on the other. “I was nervous! So, anyway, when the season 7 wrap party came, I knew it was the last night I would see him. I was like, ‘Geez, I guess I have to be stronger about my moves.'” Holker said. “I hadn’t planned on going because I’m a mom and don’t really go out and party. But when he texted to see if I was going, I was ready and in the car! I showed up and people were trying to say hi, but I was on a mission to find this guy. I saw him at the other end of the room, and he pointed and did this little ‘come here’ motion. We went upstairs and danced for three hours straight.”</p><p>The two got engaged in 2013 when tWitch proposed to Holker while filming a commercial. They married that December at So You Think You Can Dance judge and creator Nigel Lythgoe winery in Paso Robles, California. Their first child together, son Maddox, was born on 2016.&nbsp;Holker and tWitch share two children: son Maddox, 6, and daughter Zaia, 3. tWitch was also the stepfather to Holker’s daughter, Weslie Fowler, from a previous relationship.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in February 2022, Holker revealed that she told tWitch he was The One three weeks into dating. “Three weeks into us dating, I told him that he was my one,” she said. “I was so confident.” tWitch, however, didn’t know Holker was The One until three months after their first dance at the So You Think You Can Dance season 7 wrap party when the two were on a date and came across a house that was being remodeled and decide to have a look around. “We hopped the fence, we found the door that’s open and the alarm goes off,” he said. “I turned to look and Allison’s already running and as I’m sprinting to catch up with her, I know it’s the weirdest thought, but I’m like, ‘Yo, I’m going to marry this woman.’ That just let me know she’s the one.”</p><p>Holker told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">OK magazine</a> in October 2022, two months before tWitch’s death, that she and her husband were still in their “honeymoon phase.” “We already spent so much time together, but now we wake up, we go to our office together, we work together all day. I know a lot of people probably think that sounds crazy, but we love it. We’re together all day every day and we are just living our best married life. I feel like we’re back in the honeymoon phase again!” she said at the time.</p><p>She continued, “People around us are like, ‘Oh my gosh, you guys are still in that lovey phase.’ We haven’t gotten out of it all! He inspires me every single day, and I think we share such a mutual respect for each other. I respect him as a man, a father, and he does the same for me. I feel like there’s a lot of appreciation and respect, and I think that’s what really helps us is that we stay engaged with each other. There’s not a day that goes by that either one of us do something for each other and we don’t say thank you for going the extra mile. We explore that in our relationship a lot. I make it really, really important.”</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis, help is available.

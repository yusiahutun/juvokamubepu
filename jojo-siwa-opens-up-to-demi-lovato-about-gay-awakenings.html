"I think I realized that my very first gay awakening was Jenna Dewan's performance on 'Lip Sync Battle.' I think that was one of them."</p><p>The 18-year-old Nickelodeon star continued, "But do you remember your dancer, her name is JoJo Gomez, and you did 'Cool for the Summer' together? I remember seeing that and just being a little too interested."</p><p>"When I did 'Cool for the Summer,' that song for me was my way of sharing with the world without confirming that I was bisexual," Demi said. "But like I said, I didn't come out until 2017. But 'Cool for the Summer' was like 2014, 2015, so that to me, it was my way of saying, 'I'm not ready to come out but...'"</p><p>"I want to share this, but I don't know how yet," JoJo chimed in.</p><p>"Yes. I'm so happy you can see a little glimpse of that pride through that performance," said Demi, who came out as non-binary in May.</p><p>JoJo revealed that Demi also sparked a "gay awakening" for her girlfriend, Kylie Prew.</p><p>"Yesterday I was talking to my girlfriend, Kylie, about our gay awakenings," JoJo recalled, "and she said she went to your concert and it was that concert -- she would have probably had to have been 12, maybe, or 13, and she was there with her mom."</p><p>"I'm so happy I could play a role," Demi said with a laugh.</p><p>Also during the chat, JoJo admitted that she "always knew" she was gay but said she held off on coming out publicly until she was in a relationship.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9376b391-4893-4d8e-ad05-320422624186 data-container-ref=toofab:article:95fe6bc8-68ad-43ac-86ca-6ad352f95363 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/12/5by4/2021/06/01/120dfd50fcf241779f5ed6d789da3e79_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">JoJo Siwa Says She's Trying To Get Scene of Her Kissing a Man Cut From Upcoming Film</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I always knew with me, but I always said I'm not going to do anything with it or be like, 'Hey, by the way, I'm gay, but I'm not in love with a girl yet,'" she shared. "I was like, 'I'll wait until I actually have a girlfriend or I have a girl that I'm in love with and I'll do something with it.' And that happened."</p><p>JoJo said she then waited until her girlfriend and her family were "ready" before she came out.</p><p>"The only thing that held me back from telling the world right away was my girlfriend's family and my girlfriend because I wanted to make sure that she was ready," she told Demi.</p><p>"The internet kind of outed me for me and all I had to do was confirm it," she added with a laugh. "What happened was I did a TikTok with these TikTokers and they kind of outed me. They were like, 'Oh my god, I feel so bad. We don't want people thinking this about you.' And I was like, 'Well truthfully, I don't mind it because it's true.'"</p><a id=gallery-link-21cade45-17f7-4521-93ab-2d84d040fa7a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:21cade45-17f7-4521-93ab-2d84d040fa7a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:95fe6bc8-68ad-43ac-86ca-6ad352f95363 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7a/4by3/2021/02/08/7a9613be58ce4a4f969b6b74b3fa3e19_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j3Bmamxfn7yru4ysoLCZXaS9prrSZqypZaSkeqWxzKJkpaemlsGwecCbpq6sXZyuunnAsJiknZ6eu6i%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cross-dressing-killer-known-ms-puppy-sentenced-30-years-bludgeoning-death-gay-couple-hired-housekeeper-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Cross-dressing killer known as 'Ms Puppy' sentenced to 30 years for bludgeoning gay couple to death</span></a>

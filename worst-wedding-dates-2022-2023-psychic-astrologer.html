Why you may ask? Certain days have been deemed unlucky (with one even symbolising war and anxiety!), due to the position of the planets – we've all heard about the nightmares that come with Mercury in retrograde.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eOxieTMww8ih data-wc=16><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;7 of the most expensive royal weddings of all time – who takes top spot?</strong></p><p id=eyCuv9nTU5u5 data-wc=29>Fear not, there are also plenty of very lucky wedding dates you'll want to secure your venue.

This means that the influences of each planet manifest in unhelpful ways.</p><p id=esxc_ELO-8UZ data-wc=46>According to the astrologer, on this date, Saturn (the planet of maturity), Jupiter (the planet of wealth), Neptune (the planet of spirituality) and Uranus (the planet of change) are retrograde all day. Plus, Mercury (the planet of communication and logic) is also retrograde in the morning.</p><p id=es1iNPLhvq3M data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Find your dream wedding décor according to your horoscope</a></strong></p><p id=ebA1M7bReHUT data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="How to have a child-free wedding without offending friends and family" class=hm-link href=#>How to have a child-free wedding without offending friends and family</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Best dates to get married in 2022</h2><p id=eqJWnMaEyohC data-wc=35>"Now that a lot of the year is behind us, not that many perfect days remain for marriage in 2022. However, some of the luckiest wedding dates for 2022 are still to come!" Inbaal said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d307f55240d8-couple-wedding-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e2LR7fQjksck data-wc=8><strong>Two dates in September 2022 are considered lucky</strong></p><p id=eIt1oN7_dNC3 data-wc=44>Couples who have scheduled their big day for 10 September should rejoice, as that is considered the luckiest wedding date this year. Pisces is a very romantic zodiac sign, while Virgo is a very sensible sign, which makes for a perfect concoction in marriage!</p><p id=eOcIG4yEk8ui data-wc=69>Inbaal explained that the full moon in Pisces, which comes just once a year, is on this date, at the same time that the sun is in Virgo. "The sun being opposite the moon isn't exactly harmonious, but it does mean that each partner will be able to keep their own identity in the marriage, so it's a great date for unique personalities to tie the knot," she added.</p><p id=eccf9jfBl2Ux data-wc=19>There are also another two dates that got the thumbs up from Inbaal – 25 September and 23 December.</p><p id=eL8fNTWacMBP data-wc=43>In the afternoon of the September date, both the sun and the new moon are in Libra – a star sign with a great balancing influence that can help smooth conflict. This means couples will find it easy to compromise in their marriage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e574fd42cd94-wedding-dates-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=exDIkBvJEbG6 data-wc=12><strong>Psychic and astrologer Inbaal Honigman revealed when not to tie the knot</strong></p><p id=eJhT_je4P9D2 data-wc=66>Meanwhile, the late December date may be close to Christmas celebrations, but it will supposedly encourage an abundant marriage. This is because the new moon and the sun are in Capricorn, a star sign that is meant to be good with business and finances. Joining them there are Mercury, and Venus (the planet of love) — and who wouldn't want a romantic and financially blessed marriage?</p><h2 dir=ltr>Worst dates to get married in 2023</h2><p id=e4FiNSq6mjD9 data-wc=46>September 2023 is less fortunate! Specifically, 3 September will reportedly bring anxiety and war to couples, largely due to the Mercury retrograde which will make communication uneasy. Venus, Saturn (the planet of karma) and the three outer planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, are all also retrograde.&nbsp;</p><p id=eyazQD43gP9h data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Wedding heatwave hacks! 7 expert tips to deal with hot weather on your big day" class=hm-link href=#>Wedding heatwave hacks! 7 expert tips to deal with hot weather on your big day</a></strong></p><p id=e8yVpRNEd_pC data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Zodiac weddings: 12 gorgeous venues for your star sign</a></strong></p><p id=es5HYl3ae8WY data-wc=34>"The only planet free to do its own thing is Mars, the planet of war!"

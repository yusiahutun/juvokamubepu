Although Radner passed away in 1989, her husband, Gene Wilder, and Joanna Bull, along with other friends and family, answered Radner’s call to action. Together, they founded Gilda’s Club and opened its iconic Red Door in New York City in 1995.</p><p>Gilda’s Club Quad Cities was founded when a group of local oncology nurses saw a need for social and emotional support for cancer patients and their families in the area.&nbsp;They approached Rich Horst asking for his help and he gathered a founding board of local community leaders in 1995 and together they began the process to establish a Gilda’s Club in the Quad Cities.</p><p>Gilda’s Club Quad Cities opened its clubhouse doors on Nov. 8, 1998, at the mansion on the hill with the red doors along River Drive in Davenport, Iowa.&nbsp;This was the second Gilda’s Club in the nation to open its doors to the community.</p><p>Gilda’s Club Quad Cities made its home at our clubhouse on River Drive until December 2020.</p><p>In February 2021 the first clubhouse opened in Moline inside UnityPoint Health – Trinity just down the hall from its cancer center. The Davenport clubhouse opened the following year in September 2022 at Genesis Health Systems West Campus directly above its cancer center.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/11/Gildas-Club-Quad-Cities.jpg><p>Since opening our doors in 1998, Gilda’s Club Quad Cities has served close to 4,500 people living with cancer and their loved ones.

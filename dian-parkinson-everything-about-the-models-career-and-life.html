She was born Dianna Lynn Batts in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on November 30, 1944.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/326774101_850910406197671_6016360357536723308_n.jpg><p>Parkinson spent most of her childhood living in a church called Falls Church in Virginia, where she was raised. Her parents’ identities are unknown, and whether they raised her or others is unclear.</p><p>Since she lived and grew up in a church, most people assume that her parents and church members raised her.&nbsp;She mostly stays out of the public eye now but has listed a residence in Westlake Village, California.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dian_Parkinsons_Modeling_Career></span>Dian Parkinson’s Modeling Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While living in the church, Parkinson competed in the Miss District of Columbia USA beauty pageant in 1965 and won the prize title. Later that same year, she competed as Dianna Batts in the Miss USA 1965 pageant and placed fourth runner-up.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting a solid love for beauty pageants, she competed in her third competition for that year, the Miss USA World contest, in which she came out victorious and was crowned the queen. She participated in her fourth competition for the year, representing the United States in the International Miss World 1965 contest, and placed first runner-up. British model Lesley Langley won the competition that year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dian_Parkinson_in_the_Price_Is_Right></span>Dian Parkinson in the Price Is Right&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Parkinson was a model for the hit TV show “The Price Is Right” from 1975 to 1993. She had a lengthy 18-year run on the show and was known by millions worldwide for her stunning looks. It surprised fans when the show announced that she was leaving to “pursue other interests.”</p><p>Her tenure on the show was one of the longest among its models, second only to Janice Pennington, who stayed for over 28 years. Fans were stunned when Pennington abruptly left the show in 1993 without prior notice to “pursue other interests.”</p><p>Parkinson went on to feature in other shows and a couple of movies before she retired quietly. She made her final TV appearance in 1994 as a guest on the late-night show “Space Ghost: Coast to Coast.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dian_Parkinson_and_Bob_Barkers_Relationship_and_Lawsuit></span>Dian Parkinson and Bob Barker’s Relationship and Lawsuit<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Parkinson and “The Price Is Right” host <a href=#>Bob Barker</a> worked as colleagues on the show for 18 years.

She alleged that Barker coerced her into a three-year sexual relationship, threatening her with termination if she refused.</p><p>Barker denied all allegations, calling Parkinson a disgruntled employee, and continued hosting the TV show without interruption. In April 1995, Parkinson withdrew her lawsuit, citing health concerns and the exorbitant legal fees as her reasons.</p><p>Surprisingly, most fans believe Parkinson’s claims to this day.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dian_Parkinsons_Obituary></span>Dian Parkinson’s Obituary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like many other celebrities, hoaxes, and rumors of Dian Parkinson’s demise have circulated the internet several times. Some attention-seeking social media users find it fun to spread distressing news about celebrities dying without evidence.&nbsp;</p><p>To our knowledge, the former model is still alive and kicking. She is 79 as of 2023 and lives a quiet life in her California residence.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Dian_Parkinson_Appear_in_Playboy></span>Did Dian Parkinson Appear in Playboy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thanks to her good looks, Dian Parkinson was a cover girl for multiple magazines, including the famous Playboy magazine.

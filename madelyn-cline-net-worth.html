She told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Elle</a> in August 2021 about what it was like for her boyfriend to also play her love interest. “It’s nice because you’re both going through it at the same time. We all are, as a cast, so it’s wonderful to have that shared experience together, but it’s especially nice just for [Chase and I] to have gone through this experience together. I feel like we’ve become incredibly close because of it,” she said at the time.</p><p>She also revealed at the time that she and Stokes had an agreement to leave work at work and not let it affect their relationship. “There’s definitely got to be a healthy balance and a healthy boundary. We’ve talked about this before: My work headspace is really important and sacred to me, and to him as well,” she said. “We do our best to protect that. So whenever there’s any sort of personal issue, especially between the two of us, we don’t bring it to work. Because it’s distracting.</p><p>In November 2021, People confirmed that <a href=# rel=noopener>Cline and Stokes had split</a> after less than two years together. “Madelyn and Chase are no longer together,” a source said at the time. “They were trying to work things out privately but broke up a couple of months ago.” A source also told Us Weekly at the time that the former couple’s “busy schedules” had a lot to do with why their <a href=# rel=noopener>relationship didn’t work</a>.&nbsp;“They’ve been trying to work it out for quite some time but decided going their separate ways was best,” the insider said. “They both have busy schedules, which made it hard for them to spend a lot of time together. They have no bad feelings toward each other and remain friends.”</p><p>So what is <a href=# id=auto-tag_madelyn-cline data-tag=madelyn-cline>Madelyn Cline</a>‘s net worth and how much does she make on Outer Banks and other projects? Read on for what we know about how much Madelyn Cline’s net worth ahead.</p><h2>How much does Madelyn Cline make on Outer Banks?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Glass-Onion.jpg><p>How much does Madelyn Cline make on Outer Banks? Unfortunately, Cline’s Outer Banks salary—and how much the rest of her cast makes—isn’t known. But given that Outer Banks season 2 was the most-viewed show on Nielsen’s list in August 2021—with more than 1,160 million views and 2.1 billion minutes on Nielsen’s report—we’re sure that the cast is making a decent amount of money.</p><p>As for the Outer Banks‘ cast’s salary, we can estimate that the cast likely made around what the casts of other Netflix shows, such as Stranger Things, made in their first and second seasons. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the teen stars of Stranger Things made $20,000 per episode for season 1 before they received $60,000 raises for season 2. While the Outer Banks cast’s salary isn’t known, the cast’s current salary is likely in the $20,000 and $80,000-per-episode range.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Access Hollywood</a> in March 2023, Cline revealed that she was living out of her car months before she booked her role on Outer Banks. “I was definitely living out of my car because my first apartment we got bed bugs,” she said. “Three or four months after the bed bug apartment incident, I booked Boy Erased. I was so excited to be a part of it. After that, I worked on a couple of indies. A few months after, I got my audition for Outer Banks. I went to Charleston to meet with the producers. Then I got the job.”</p><p>Showrunner Jonas Pate also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2020 that she expects Outer Banks to run for four to five seasons, which means there’s room for the cast’s salary to go up even more. “Ever since we started, we always viewed it as something that was probably like a four-season, maybe five-season show, but definitely four seasons,” he said. “We’ve sort of long-arced it out pretty far. I’m just hoping that we get a chance to actually tell those stories.”</p><p>Cline stars as Sarah Cameron in Outer Banks, which premiered on Netflix in April 2020. The show is set in a coastal town along the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where there’s a social divide between the Kooks, wealthy residents, and the Pogues, working-class locals. The teen drama follows a group of Pogues as they investigate what happened to the missing father of their ringleader, John B., which leads them to a hunt for a treasure worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Cline’s character Sarah Cameron is John B.’s love interest and the daughter of his arch nemesis, Ward Cameron. Though she’s a Kook, Sarah rejects the lifestyle of her family and chooses to the side with the Pogues.</p><p>“Everything has been so overwhelming in the most incredible way,” Cline told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Seventeen</a> in May 2020 about the reaction to Outer Banks. “The fan base are all so sweet. Everything has kind of just exploded, which is everything we ever really wished for. People have been so receptive to the show and to the characters. I think I can speak for the entire cast when I say we are so, so grateful.”</p><h2>How much did Madelyn Cline make from Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/entertainment-newsletter-banner.jpg><p>How much did Madelyn cline make from Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery? Cline was cast in Knives Out 2 in June 2021. The movie, which also stars Dave Bautista, Janelle Monae, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr., Kate Hudson and Edward Norton, was the sequel to 2019’s Knives Out, which follows Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), a master detective who’s hired to investigate the death of the patriarch of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. Cline played Whiskey, the girlfriend of Duke (played by Dave Bautista) and a Twitch channel assistant. How much Cline made from Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery exactly, but given that Knives Out&nbsp; grossed $311.4 million worldwide and made a net profit of $82 million, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a>, it’s clear that the franchise is a blockbuster. According to a 2021 report by Variety, Craig made $100 million for Knives Out 2 and 3.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Madelyn Cline’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So what is Madelyn Cline’s net worth? According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Gossip Gist</a>, Madelyn Cline’s net worth around $800,000, which makes her one of the richest cast members in Outer Banks. (Her ex-boyfriend, Chase Stokes, is worth $650,000, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">PopBuzz</a>.) Along with Outer Banks and Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Cline has also starred in movies like Savannah Sunrise, Boy Erased and This Is the Night, as well as TV shows like Vice Principals, The Originals and Stranger Things. She’s also had collaborations with brands like Set Active and Aro Swim.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">W magazine</a> in 2022, Cline opened up about what it was like to become an overnight celebrity after Outer Banks premiered in 2020. “It’s an interesting dichotomy. I consider myself to be a very private person. Sometimes the lack of anonymity really wigs me out. People think they know you because they know your character, when in reality, they’re two different people,” she said. She also explained the similarities between her and her Outer Banks character, Sarah Cameron. “There are parts of teenagehood that I get to relive and make right in my mind. Sarah’s journey has been all about standing up for herself and finding her own footing,” she said. “I’ve had many conversations with our writers and producers on how to make it feel very real and visceral to a young woman’s experience growing into adulthood. But you know, I’m now 24, almost 25, playing a 16-, 17-year-old. So there’s going to be some logic there that I don’t agree with. It can be a little chaotic…I have to go back and revisit the mind of a teenager who doesn’t yet completely know what she wants.”</p><p>Cline also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2023 about how Sarah has changed since season 1 out of Outer Banks. “We’ve seen her truly grow up a lot. She’s gone from a teenager who doesn’t have much of a care in the world or responsibilities to having the weight of so many things on her shoulders,” she said. “She’s learned that family is not just something that you are born into but something that you can choose. She’s learning to speak up for herself, put her foot down, and learning to discern what is right and wrong versus right or wrong being something that you’re told. This season, we continue to piggyback on that with a few wrenches thrown into the mix. She found this voice, and she’s learning how to make decisions for herself.”</p><p>She continued of how she relates to Sarah, “What it comes down to is finding the empathy for me, because sometimes I’ll read things, and me, personally, as Maddie, will be like, ‘What the fuck?’ With any character, I’m approaching them with empathy and figuring out the why. Moral dilemmas are really fun to play because there’s so much there. I just hope that what I’ve portrayed feels truthful and authentic. But truthfully, that ebbing and flowing and growing, especially that we experience as teenagers and young adults, I hope that resonates true to our audience. I think that it’s all very human — finding your chosen family, realizing that mistakes happen and the ins and the outs of relationships and friendships. Life in and of itself is so messy, and it’s very cathartic and beautiful to play.”</p><p>Cline also told Variety about how how she’s been labeled as “too sexy” because of the characters she’s played. “Self-love is a daily journey,” she said. “Your relationship with your body is so deeply personal, and then in this industry, it gets objectified. That’s a really hard thing to balance in a very weird dichotomy. I think the main thing is truly letting my body be what it is, and not feeling like I need to make it what other people want it to be. So: being honest or being upfront about weight fluctuation! It happens. I think truly that sexy is being confident in your own skin and whatever that means to you. That’s something that I’ve had to preach back at myself as well. Because I think that that’s what shows, especially on-screen.”</p><p>As for what she’s learned from Outer Banks, Cline told Variety, “Calm down and embrace everything — good and bad, highs and lows. All of it is very informative. The best thing you can do is just get out and go experience things and live. And don’t compare yourself.”</p><p>Cline also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Teen Vogue</a> in 2023 about how her life has changed since the success of Outer Banks. “It’s really cool. It’s so funny. I find myself in awe all the time,” she said. “We kind of had lightning in a bottle season 1, and I was so excited about the response to season 1, I just kept thinking like when is it going to end? Are we running out of luck? Are people going to get tired of it? And it hasn’t happened yet. People still really love it. It means the world because this project means the world to us as the cast, but the other half of making a show is also putting it in front of people, and seeing how they receive it. To see that be such a positive response time and time again is just the most overwhelming and amazing thing to watch.”</p><p>As for how Sarah has grown, Cline told Teen Vogue, “I think Sarah has grown up a lot and she’s gone through a lot. She’s gone through things, in my opinion, that have caused her to have to grow up quickly. She chose maybe a route that wasn’t going to have the same kind of comfortable life. She was going to have to speak her mind, even though it was going to cause her and her family to clash. And she chose her chosen family over her real family because of what she believed in.”</p><p>She also told the magazine about how growing up in Charleston, South Carolina, near where Outer Banks films, helped her with the role. “At least for me, some of my job on the day, besides bringing my work that I’ve done at home with me, is feeling my surroundings,” she said. “Your surroundings can be very, very informative and there’s a physicality to like each role. There was already a sense of home about shooting in South Carolina because it is home. And so I feel like that was kind of already ingrained. It all felt very familiar. Also, two of our showrunners, they have kids that are about the Pogues and Kooks age. And so I think for them in the writing it was already on the page for us. But I think for me, personally, I already had that sense built in. It all came kind of natural for me.”</p><p>Outer Banks is available to stream on Netflix.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

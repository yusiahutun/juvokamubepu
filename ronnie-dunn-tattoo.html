"He puts a stencil of 'Cowboy' on my arm, and it's about this long. [He holds his fingers a few inches apart.] And he says 'Stand in front of the mirror and see how it feels.' I did all the poses and everything, and they were kind of snickering in the back. And I went, 'It's not big enough, is it, guys?' And they were like, 'Nah, it's not big enough.' So we get a stencil that's a little bit bigger, and 'It's not big enough, is it?' 'No…' So finally, it's from here to here."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq6eeo7amecOupadlpJbBtbvOaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amish-cannabis-farmers-pennsylvania-lancaster-county-california-midwest-html.html><span>←</span><span>Inside the booming business of Amish cannabis farmers in Pennsylvania where a green revolution is un</span></a>

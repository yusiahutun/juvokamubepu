The ultimate guide to what not to do - and the engagement ring to avoid</h1></header><section class=post-content><p id=eg5coU4Dv4 data-wc=32>Are you planning an engagement and&nbsp;don't know where to start? Not sure what ring they might like or where the best spot to propose is? Don't worry, we've got you covered.&nbsp;</p><p id=eu8Awr9SuZp data-wc=41>As we're in the midst of 'proposal season', considered to run from November to February, we thought that we'd share&nbsp;the findings of some new&nbsp;research by&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollownoopener nofollow">ROX Diamonds & Thrills</a>&nbsp;that reveals what the nightmare proposal looks like. Some of these stats are crazy!</p><p id=eyJCoLenGFC data-wc=13><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;What would you do if you received an engagement ring you hated?</strong></p><p id=eRrRxD02-do data-wc=55>The study asked 2,000 heterosexual men and women in the UK what the nightmare proposal looks like and the findings were interesting. Thinking of having a public proposal? Think again, because&nbsp;96 per cent&nbsp;of women revealed they don't want their proposal to happen in public - that includes in front of family and friends.</p><p id=ey46jaYxH52 data-wc=35>Meanwhile, 86 per cent&nbsp;of women revealed that when it&nbsp;comes to popping the question, they&nbsp;would rather have a more intimate moment with their beau than a public display of affection. No PDA, please!</p><p id=e2e-iR3ns7I data-wc=57>The study as a whole seemed to dismiss the cliches we often see in TV and films with women saying they don't want to be proposed to in fancy restaurants, hotels or in front of famous landmarks. Instead, the study found that most women would enjoy having their engagement be somewhere personal and meaningful to their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b7a97883a61a-proposal-restaurant-z.jpg><p id=eqqVN381mygO data-wc=9><strong>Private and meaningful locations are favoured over public places</strong></p><p id=eRqlzDAX5ain data-wc=39>Kyron Keogh, Co-founder of ROX Diamonds & Thrills, explained: "While it's easier to think your partner may want something straight out of a fairytale, in reality, they might want something much simpler and personal to you as a couple."</p><p id=epZzwBFoZCMn data-wc=66>So once you've decided on where to propose, the next thing is to find the ring. According to Google search data, the most common question that people ask surrounding engagement rings is how much you should spend on them. According to ROX's study, the perfect amount to spend on the ring is £1,429, but 90 per cent&nbsp;of people said they would pay up to £3,000!</p><p id=eIF124o8CjeX data-wc=1><strong>DETAILS:</strong>&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>12 private royal proposals: Countess Sophie's Bahamas holiday, Zara Tindall's movie night & more</a></p><p id=eID04TqiL6_E data-wc=53>Ring prices vary according to the gemstone used and the carat&nbsp;of the gold or silver band. The research indicated that diamonds are still a girl's best friend with over half of women wanting a diamond - if you're in the market, <a class=hm-link href=#>shop our edit of best diamond engagement rings</a>&nbsp;- and the least popular choices being aquamarine, opals and amethysts.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6ad24b6d7f9b-opal-ring-z.jpg><p id=emg7jDoHFZhJ data-wc=8><strong>Opal&nbsp;and amethyst engagement rings are not popular</strong></p><p id=eFvYAsvYqjhq data-wc=100>Now you have your ring and you've picked the perfect spot, all that's left is to find the right moment. Don't worry, ROX's study looked into this as well and found the perfect amount of time to wait before proposing and the days that you should absolutely avoid.&nbsp;The survey found that four&nbsp;out of five&nbsp;women thought that the three-year mark was when an engagement should happen. Only one&nbsp;in six&nbsp;women thought couples should be together for four&nbsp;or five&nbsp;years before a proposal with less than 1 per cent&nbsp;thinking it should be any longer than that.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a8abf02b4556-oval-engagement-ring-z.jpg><p id=eKJkA1Ztqv3w data-wc=5><strong>Diamond oval engagement ring, £1,750, <span><a aria-label=goldsmiths class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Goldsmiths</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label=goldsmiths class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=eWnwGVzUv9hn data-wc=82>If you're hitting the three-year mark it could be time to pop the question as the most popular day that women want&nbsp;to be proposed to is on their anniversary. Over a third of women agreed that this was the best day for an engagement followed by one in five women saying their birthday. The most popular time to propose is between November and February so somewhere within this time is usually a success, as long as you avoid New Year's Day.</p><p id=eGB6eWW2Mfhp data-wc=45>So it's safe to say that a nightmare proposal would happen in public, at a fancy restaurant&nbsp;on New Year's Day with an opal engagement ring. As long as you steer clear of this horror show, you should be safe to secure the perfect engagement.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFFc7lmWpUub data-wc=1><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>8 of the best men's engagement rings for a proposal</a></strong></p><p id=eHk4_u9B9TAg data-wc=41>HELLO!'s selection is editorial and independently chosen – we only feature items our editors love and approve of.

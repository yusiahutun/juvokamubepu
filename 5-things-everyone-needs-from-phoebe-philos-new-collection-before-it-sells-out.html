Phoebe Philo is of British heritage, even though she was born in Paris, France. After graduating from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London, in 1996 Philo began working for Chloé in 1997 as Stella McCartney's design assistant, succeeding her as creative director in 2001.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Phoebe Philo announces her new brand launching in 2023" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4b6fa7beb5ac-phoebephilott-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Phoebe Philo announces her new brand launching in 2023" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Phoebe Philo announces her new brand launching in 2023</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="10 things you may not know about Phoebe Philo" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d5e1399d53c6-designer-phoebe-philo.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="10 things you may not know about Phoebe Philo" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>10 things you may not know about Phoebe Philo</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eTSUqA3kjU data-wc=104>It was during her time at Chloe and Celine that she designed the cultivated Chloé Paddington handbag, Chloé banana print, Celine scarf-print shirt, Celine camel coat and the Celine ‘Luggage’ tote. The now mother of three continues to live in London with her children and Husband, juggling motherhood and a soon-to-be sell-out luxury fashion house. Her 10-year stint at Celine gained her a fashion fandom only few can be so lucky to ever experience.

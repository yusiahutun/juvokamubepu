She is the <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">youngest of six siblings</a>, three brothers and three sisters. Since she was the youngest in the <a href=#>family</a>, she was extremely close to her parents, especially her father.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7be42e4029758350.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Anthony Strangis and where is he today?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Elisabeth did a course in Vienna and desired to become a waitress. However, her dreams were cut short.</p><h2>Elisabeth Fritzl’s story?</h2><p class=align-left>Elisabeth's story is one of the saddest as she was imprisoned by his father, who also sexually abused her. So, how did it start?</p><p class=align-left>The girl in the basement went missing on August 28, 1984, when she had just turned 18. Worried, her mother filed a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">missing person's report</a> to determine her daughter's whereabouts. However, a letter came allegedly from Elisabeth stating that she had grown tired of home and had run away.</p><p class=align-left>According to her father's statement to the police, he didn't know where she might have gone but had likely joined a religious cult. He stated that she had mentioned such a story before.</p><p class=align-left>Unknown to everyone, Josef Fritzl had imprisoned her daughter in the basement of their house and was just 20 feet below. Josef tricked her daughter into the cellar on August 28, 1984, when he asked her to help fix the door.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/850791058ea90092.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Karla Brown story: What happened and the latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The basement was Elisabeth's new home for the next 24 years, and her father was the only thing she would see. Josef continuously fed lies to his wife and the police. As a result, the police's investigation didn't bring any leads, and the case ran cold.</p><p class=align-left>Over the years, Josef sexually assaulted her daughter, and she would get pregnant. She got her first child in August 1988 and had another child two years later. The two children, Kerstin and Stefan, stayed in the basement with their mother for the duration of their imprisonment. Elisabeth Fritzl gave birth to five more children over the next 24 years.</p><h3>Escape from captivity</h3><p class=align-left>In a strange turn of events, Josef released Elisabeth from the basement to see her daughter on April 26, 2008, for the first time in 24 years.</p><p class=align-left>And that is how everything unfolded, and the secret Josef held for 24 years came out. Elisabeth Fritzl narrated the entire story to the police, and her father was later arrested. After Josef's arrest, all the children were released, and Rosemarie Fritzl fled the home.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/32406cce4f5097e5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Michele Carey biography: The life and times of the El Dorado star</span></p></a><h2>Where is Elisabeth Fritzl now?</h2><p class=align-left>People have wondered about Elisabeth Fritzl's whereabouts after her terrible 24-year ordeal. And the fact that she went silent after the incident came out, others are even asking, "Did Elisabeth Fritzl survive?”</p><p class=align-left>Today, Elisabeth lives under a new identity in a secret location identified as "Village X". Her new home is constantly under CCTV surveillance and police cover every corner, so it is hard to know her exact location.</p><p class=align-left>Elisabeth's family doesn't allow any interviews. So, even though Elisabeth is now 56, her last photo was taken when she was only 16 years old.</p><p class=align-left>After the story of Elisabeth Fritzl in the basement came out, Josef was arrested. His trial started on March 16, 2009, in the city of Sankt Polten, presided over by Judge Andrea Humer. He now serves a <a href=#>life sentence</a> without the possibility of parole in 15 years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/390e247743961b0c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dorothea Hurley: Here's the untold story of Bon Jovi's wife</span></p></a><h2>What happened to the mother of Elisabeth Fritzl?</h2><p class=align-left>Rosemarie Fritzl was shocked after finding out that her long-lost daughter had been in their house’s basement all along. She had no idea what was happening in the basement of the family’s home in Amstetten, Austria.</p><p class=align-left>After the horrors, Rosemarie was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">taken into care</a> and is now believed to be living in Linz. The place is only 30 miles from her previous home. However, her <a href=#>daughter’s relationship </a>wasn’t that good after she was released because she was devastated that her mother believed Josef’s story of running away.</p><h2>Who are Josef Fritzl's children with Elisabeth?</h2><p class=align-left>Elisabeth had seven children fathered by her dad while he kept her captive in the basement. The eldest, Kerstin, was born on August 30, 1988, while Stefan was born on February 1, 1990.

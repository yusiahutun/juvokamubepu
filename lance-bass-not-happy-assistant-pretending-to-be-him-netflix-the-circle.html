Regardless of who they are or pretend to be, the most popular contestant at the end of the whole thing -- or the top influencer -- scores a cool $100,000.</p><p>Lisa opted to play not as herself, but rather as Lance, a move he called "really bad gameplay" in an interview with Us Weekly. In fact, he thinks she probably doomed her chance at winning the show with the decision.</p><p>What's worse, she apparently went rogue from a game plan the two reality game buffs concocted before she went in there. "We had a whole plan set," he explained. "She did the exact opposite of what I told her."</p><p>They did agree that she could talk about him, and he put absolutely no restrictions on what she could and couldn't share. Certainly, after all their years together, she knows enough about him to pretend to be him, but he thinks it was a disastrous choice.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:80c9509e-7b7b-4017-b5a6-d46fdf9567b5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6c8e95b2-9d34-405d-9d0c-96a3f75de3af data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a9/5by4/2021/03/24/a9f8de8ee2564a50a5d70b2bb22d9e03_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC/TooFab</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lance Bass Says He's 'Too Old' For Another Shot At DWTS Amid Judge Bias Claims (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In fact, if he ever got a chance on the show, he would never feel confident competing as Lance Bass. "I would go on there as my assistant," he said. "I wouldn’t want people to think it’s actually me because the main thing is -- especially when it’s a public figure and something like this -- no one wants you to win because to them you’ve already won in life and you don’t need the money and all that."</p><p>It's been seen time and again, when celebrities or star athletes have opted to compete on shows like "Survivor" -- or even just someone revealing they have a lot of wealth -- the others almost immediately want to boot them because they don't need the money.</p><p>Spoiler alert warning for those tuning in, or planning to tune in, Lisa was "blocked" at the end of the eighth episode, which technically means she was voted out of the game. But her journey isn't over -- even if "Lance" appears to be through.</p><p>She's partnered with another blocked contestant to compete with a brand new profile. Maybe this time, she can stick to the plan?</p><p>"The Circle" drops new installments in four-episode blocks every Wednesday on Netflix.</p><a id=gallery-link-bfe68e7b-bad0-4e05-83aa-49ddcc7558d4 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:bfe68e7b-bad0-4e05-83aa-49ddcc7558d4 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:6c8e95b2-9d34-405d-9d0c-96a3f75de3af data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/47/4by3/2021/04/24/47ad4f0ec207456d9deb719a36dd6d22_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j21ma21foa6vr8RmmZqro2K7sMCMoZipqKlirrS%2FyKyrmqakYr2zsdOepZ2hnpx6tbuMm5xmoJmieq%2Bx05%2BjorBdqbWmecKiqZyklWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sephora-holiday-gifts.html><span>←</span><span>Glow Recipe, Fenty Beauty &amp;amp; More</span></a>

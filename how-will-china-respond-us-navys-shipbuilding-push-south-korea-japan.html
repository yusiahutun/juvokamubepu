When it comes to warships, the gap between them is widening ,” Woo said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As various geopolitical problems arise, Korea and Japan are the only countries with the capabilities to produce a certain volume of warships and submarines.

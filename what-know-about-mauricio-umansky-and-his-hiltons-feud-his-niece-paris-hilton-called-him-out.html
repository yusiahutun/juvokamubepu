Though it’s since been sold to new owners, the family’s Beverly Hills mansion that RHOBH viewers have seen for most the show’s 12 seasons also features on Buying Beverly Hills. The house was famously rented by two other Housewives: Sutton Stracke (Beverly Hills) and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Larsa Pippen (Miami)</span></a>, and was assigned to Alexia to sell, per Bravo TV.

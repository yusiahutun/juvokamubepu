It featured a sassy fringed design at the edge which helped elongate and flaunt the actress’ long legs. The skirt literally moved with the diva, adding some extra oomph to her outfit. The bright and beautiful color of the skirt also worked wonders with the diva’s complexion as well.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt="Tamannaah Bhatia’s quirky denim top and red fringed skirt outfit from Diljit Dosanjh concert is pure Gen-Z perfection (PC: Viral Bhayani)" title="Tamannaah Bhatia’s quirky denim top and red fringed skirt outfit from Diljit Dosanjh concert is pure Gen-Z perfection (PC: Viral Bhayani)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1713067938_tamannaah-bhatia-hot.jpg></p><p>This skirt was paired with a denim jacket-like top with 3/4th puffed sleeves, giving the outfit a nice twist. The upper-thigh length long top with an alluring V-shaped collared neckline was a very different choice but Bhatia’s ability to carry the outfit with panache made it work. The top was also cinched at the waist with a few buttons thereby, accentuating her enviable curves.&nbsp;</p><p>The ruched design of the top was interesting too. However, the fact that the diva completed her OOTN with black and white sneakers caught our interest. Let’s be honest, the diva’s ensemble was a true depiction of 80s fashion at its most unique with an androgynous twist. The quirky style with a side of comfort and coolness really worked for the diva. After all, fashion is all about representing yourself, and Tam’s OOTN was just a chef’s kiss.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=661b623c302f7><strong>How did Tamannaah Bhatia accessorize her chic OOTN?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Tamannaah completed her outfit with minimalistic but pretty accessories like a gorgeous gold necklace with delicate droplets, matching Gen-Z-approved hoop earrings, a bracelet, and a bold ring. These choices gave her classy outfit a well-thought-out appeal, making us fall in love with the diva's fashionable flair and creativity.&nbsp;</p><p>Bhatia further left her luscious dark locks open and styled them into natural-looking waves with a side parting that beautifully framed her face and cascaded down her shoulders and back. This effortlessly elegant and easily manageable hairstyle also ensured that Tamannaah's gorgeous face was visible.</p><p><img alt="Tamannaah Bhatia’s quirky denim top and red fringed skirt outfit from Diljit Dosanjh concert is pure Gen-Z perfection (PC: Viral Bhayani)" title="Tamannaah Bhatia’s quirky denim top and red fringed skirt outfit from Diljit Dosanjh concert is pure Gen-Z perfection (PC: Viral Bhayani)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1713067755_tamannaah-bhatia-pretty.jpg></p><p>Additionally, she added a natural-looking makeup look featuring a flawless dewy base, mascara-coated eyelashes, and a subtle pink blush. Even the perfect pink lipstick with a slight gloss made her look perfect.

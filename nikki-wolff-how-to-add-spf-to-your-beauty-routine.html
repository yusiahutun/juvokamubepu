"<a class=hm-link href=#>Skincare</a> prep is of paramount importance to me, and something I'll always spend time on before creating a makeup look. Incorporating an SPF in that routine is essential, I think Bondi Sands recognised the passion that I have for taking care of skin, so the collaboration made sense,"&nbsp;she tells us. Nikki swears by the brand's <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>SPF50+ range</a> as the base for makeup, (yes even during colder seasons) and has offered us her expert insight into the topic.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How do you advise your clients when it comes to using SPF?</strong></h2><p id=eeRZa7ulN0mZ data-wc=77>I always advise my clients to use SPF daily, even in the winter when the sun isn’t shining, as harmful rays can still make their way through the clouds.&nbsp; As most of my clients are being photographed, it’s been important that they find an SPF that leaves no residue on the skin and has no flashback on camera. The Bondi Sands SPF 50+ Face Lotion fits the bill perfectly, so it’s always high up in my recommendations.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Is it rare to find an SPF that makes a good primer?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=eOyY71dlQztx data-wc=75>SPF, like all skincare products can really vary in texture. It can be challenging to find a good SPF with high protection that doesn’t leave any white cast on the skin. I love the Bondi Sands SPF 50+ Fragrance Free Range because of how well it melts into the complexion. It’s also great for the beautiful dewy glow that it leaves, making it great as a primer when you want to achieve that radiant complexion.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Have you always worn SPF?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=ezM9X9Gd6eez data-wc=46>In my teenage years I didn't consider using a daily SPF, and as a result I have some visible sun damage on my skin. I now wear an SPF daily, and as I'm treating my pigmentation it’s more important than ever that my skin stays protected.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eGhd72LBFMGm data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="We tried London's most luxurious manicures, here's what we thought…" class=hm-link href=#>We tried London's most luxurious manicures, here's what we thought…</a></strong></p><p id=ekI7jbidaQfj data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="The 6 best lipstick shades for autumn" class=hm-link href=#>The 6 best lipstick shades for autumn</a></strong></p><p id=eLg3F0cLF8jn data-wc=10><strong>Do you find that your celebrity clients prioritise sun protection?</strong></p><p id=etDeD2g6-I2U data-wc=20>Yes absolutely. My celebrity clients understand the importance of preserving their skin health and appearance for now, and the future.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How hard is it to cover pigmentation with make-up?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=ex2mun3394KI data-wc=49>It can be challenging to cover pigmentation with make-up, while keeping skin looking natural. I recommend keeping the foundation choice sheer, but then using a colour corrector and full coverage concealer to spot treat the areas of concern. This way the complexion still looks natural and like real skin.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How do you reapply SPF over your make-up?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=efk0kXEVPPYc data-wc=27>I like to use Bondi Sands SPF 50 Fragrance Free Suncream Mist. It’s perfect for reapplying your protection throughout the day, without messing up your make up.</p><p id=eTiUwsVxhfBO data-wc=14></p><p style=font-size:12px id=ewzxSMpzEVKi data-wc=41><a class=hm-link href=#>FAQ page</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5FpaWtoaWh9coGRcmttZ56euKy1jLCmpZ6WYrWww4ytpmaZlJl6tLzFZquoZamkwrN5wZ6YrqypYr%2BwwdOipZ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./armon-warren.html><span>←</span><span>Armon Warren: Age, Height, Wiki, Wife, Family, Biography, Net Worth, Ethnicity &amp;amp; More</span></a>

Both mini speakers pack improved sound, better Bluetooth technology, new colors, and bigger clips and straps. We're also getting a powerful JBL Xtreme 4.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The outgoing models first arrived in 2020, and even though we praised the speaker in our <a href=#>JBL Clip 4 review</a>, these upgrades are very welcomed. All three speakers come in June, with the popular JBL Clip 5 debuting for $79.95, while the smaller JBL Go 4 is $49.95. The bigger JBL Xtreme 4 retails for $379.95.</p><p>As for upgrades, we'll start with the two smaller portable speakers. Both the JBL Clip 5 and Go 4 have the same rugged IP67 waterproof design as before, USB-C, and come in six all-new colors. We're getting improved sound thanks to redesigned drivers, longer battery life, <a href=#>Bluetooth v5.3 with LE audio</a>, JBL Auracast for multi-device pairing, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jbl-go-4-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>JBL's smallest portable, the Go 4, features an updated silhouette with a bigger, wider, and more durable strap. It also uses post-consumer recycled material for 80% of the plastic and 100% of the fabric. The tiny JBL Go 4 boosts battery life up from 5 hours to 7 hours of listening.</p><p>My favorite of the bunch, the JBL Clip 5, fixes two common complaints. The redesigned carabiner has a far bigger opening, making it easier to attach to nearly anything and everything. I'm talking about backpack straps, a belt loop, the leg on your camping chairs, and more. It also received a boost in the sound department, featuring an improved driver that delivers crisp sound and consistent bass at any listening level. The new and improved JBL Clip 5 has 12 hours of battery life, with an additional 3 hours using Playtime Boost Mode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jbl-xtreme-4-1.jpg><p>And finally, there's a new JBL Xtreme 4 for those wanting something bigger, better, and louder. JBL added a large shoulder strap for usability and a bigger replaceable battery to improve serviceability. Yes, those who heavily use their speaker can now replace its battery. You'll get up to 24 hours of music playback on a single charge, Bluetooth 5.3 LE, Auracast, and a new "AI Sound Boost" feature for a heightened audio experience.</p><p>The new JBL Xtreme 4 comes in three colors, works with the JBL Portable app (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone</a>), and the internal battery doubles as a portable charger for phones and gadgets. Again, the Xtreme 4 will be available in June 2024 for $379.95.</p><p>Source: JBL</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGihm6RdmLmqvIxuZLGsopq6pnmTZpmlrZWpvLDAx2aqqZ2RoLKzv4ypqaKblWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-move-apps-to-sd-card-on-an-amazon-fire-tablet.html><span>←</span><span>How to Move Apps to SD Card on an Amazon Fire Tablet</span></a>

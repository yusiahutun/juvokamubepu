"The story and emotion in it brought me back to my roots and why I love making music. It’s something I want to listen to. It is so much more than just another 'drinking' song."</p><p>“As soon as I heard it, I was in," Colleen adds. "It’s timeless. It’s country. It’s honest — also, Carter and I add a really special depth in my opinion!”</p><p>Winter and Colleen have been performing “Love Like I Drink” together on select dates in the summer of 2021, and they are planning to tour together this fall. "Love Like I Drink" is set for release on Friday (Aug. 6).</p><p>Winter released his first EP, Some Kind of Fire, in 2015, followed by 2016’s The Whiskey in Me. Winter's most recent album, Temptation, dropped in 2018. He is currently writing and recording songs for his next album, which he plans to release in 2022.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>Love-Like-I-Drink-Final-(1)</span></p>Average Joes Entertainment<p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>Please&nbsp;Enjoy&nbsp;Country's 100 Best Drinking Songs Responsibly:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnJmiqbKzedaipa2domKurbjInmScp5yhsqa6jKWmr51dobassYyiZJ2qmaO4cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carl-lumbly.html><span>←</span><span>Carl Lumbly Biography</span></a>

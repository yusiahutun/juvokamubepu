"@Sarah_Hyland Sarah [you're] the most amazing singer dam girl," one person <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "Right now i am watching the #2019 teen choice Awards and dam girl u and @Jorden killed it on stage," they added. Another shared their surprise, <a href=#>tweeting</a>, "I didn't know Sarah Hyland can sing and is a singer."</p><p>But that actually wasn't the first time Hyland has shown off her powerful voice in a public way. Three years earlier, she wowed the world when she teamed up with the band Boyce Avenue to perform a stripped down cover of The Chainsmokers and Halsey's hit "Closer," which was posted to their <a href=#>YouTube</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlha311g46cmKdlo5a%2ForSMobClmZ6ZerOxwKWjsmWjnruoew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./66279aafe2704eb9728b45c4-html.html><span>←</span><span>Atletismo: La leccin de deportividad de Mechaal: disculpa el error que le pudo costar un rcord d</span></a>

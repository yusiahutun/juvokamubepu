But I do not swim with sharks … sharks swim with sharks,” she explains.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b9/o/2015/02/05/b9e2e425c553574196389f2eaade5ca4_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The<strong> "Monster"</strong> singer also says that this particular photo shoot is probably the craziest thing she's done in a while.</p><p>"Greatest adventure? Are you kidding me? I just did a photo shoot in the midst of sharks. It's going to be pretty hard to beat that," she admits.</p><p>The 26-year-old pop star also opens up about her killer style, and reveals her favorite looks to-date.</p><p>"My favorite red-carpet looks are usually the ones I get to help design: the <a href=#><strong>Adam Selman Swarovski crystal dress</strong></a> at the CFDAs, the <a href=#><strong>Stella McCartney all-white dress</strong></a> at the Met Gala, and the Adam Selman white jersey dress from the VMAs. But the <a href=#><strong>red Azzedine Alaïa at the Grammys</strong></a> is also one of my favorites," she reveals.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c0/o/2015/02/05/c07d73c6611d57018c63b69b129a6525_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Rihanna likewise says that when it comes to fashion, she doesn't try to think about it too much. "The way I dress depends on how I feel. I never have to psych myself up. Usually it just feels like it works," she tells the mag.</p><p>The <strong>"We Found Love"</strong> singer also says that when she's off-duty, she's a pretty low-maintenance gal.</p><p>"At times [I'm] a lot of maintenance, and at times none. I have a job that requires quite a lot of glam, and I have a great team that helps me with that. But sometimes, like when I'm in the studio or on vacation, there's little to no maintenance," she confesses.</p><p>What do you think about Rihanna's comments and crazy photo shoot?

The mum-of-two was on a "well needed break" from her job managing an Elvis impersonator when the issue arose – she had already passed through security with no problems but was warned by the receptionist, reports <a data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Manchester Evening News</a>.</p><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>READ MORE: 'I quit my job to travel the world and never looked back – here's how you can too'</a></b></p><p><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow><b>Read all the latest stories from the Daily Star's travel team</b></a></p><p>She said her friend Maria had the idea to cover the dry Velcro rollers in her patterned silk scarf – and so the group scrambled together to hide her hair and make the accessory look "presentable". Lisa arrived at the the Terminal 3 lounge where she said the receptionist was a "jobsworth".</p><p>Lisa, from Sandbach, Cheshire, claims the woman asked her what was under her scarf before questioning if she had rollers in. In an attempt to get away with her ruse, Lisa said she had a scalp condition. She claims the receptionist looked at her as if she was lying about the "medical issue", before allowing her to enter the lounge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31023097.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30996328><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="'I fund holidays selling pics of my £5k-a-month feet – people always want three things'" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30996328><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31002610.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_I-fund-holidays-selling-pics-of-my-£5k-a-month-feet-theres-3-things-people-always-want.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31002610.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_I-fund-holidays-selling-pics-of-my-£5k-a-month-feet-theres-3-things-people-always-want.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30996328>'I fund holidays selling pics of my £5k-a-month feet – people always want three things'</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30931292><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|Image aria-label="'I'm an extreme stripper in Benidorm - pegging, whips and sex toys are standard'" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30931292><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30938939.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_stripperBenidorm_banner.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=30931292>'I'm an extreme stripper in Benidorm - pegging, whips and sex toys are standard'</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p>A photo showed the talent manager and property investor all glammed up with her rollers hidden by a bright scarf – she was ready to board her afternoon Ryanair flight and head to the Benidorm strip as soon as the plane touched down.</p><p>Lisa explained: said: "We were planning on going straight out, hence the rollers. We were going to arrive in our hotel rooms, quickly put our evening clothes on, brush through our hair and get ourselves out. We wanted a party night. It was all worth it. My hair was massive when I got there. It had all the volume I wanted and lasted the whole night. It was hot, but nothing that hairspray couldn't help.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30938939.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_stripperBenidorm_banner.jpg><p>"Everybody in the airport knew I had rollers in. Girls with rollers in are a common sight, especially if they're coming from Liverpool. The lady in the lounge instantly asked what was under the scarf. And then she asked if it was rollers. I said 'I've got a scalp condition, thank you'.</p><p>"She looked at me as if to say 'you're lying' but I knew she wouldn't be able to question a medical issue. I went in and every time I looked over she was staring at me. She wasn't happy at all. She didn't want me in that lounge. She was a jobsworth. Woman to woman, she knows I had rollers in."</p><p>She continued: "I had full makeup on, so it was obvious I was ready for a night out – I just needed to take the rollers out when I got there. She wanted me to stand there and take those rollers out. I always travel in rollers. I've travelled all over the world with the [Elvis] show, nearly always with rollers in. It's never been a problem before, and I always go into lounges. But for some reason they've got a new rule where you're not allowed rollers in."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>The mum posted her tale on Facebook to her 3,800 connections. She added a caption, and said: "Ok. So… Dress code for the lounge at MCR airport includes no rollers. So, I put a scarf on.</p><p>"When arriving at the said lounge desk, the jobsworth on reception says 'Have you got rollers under that scarf?' My quick reply, 'No! I've a scalp condition!' I'm now sat in the lounge with the receptionist giving me dirty looks [cry laughing emojis]. Girls' holiday here we come."</p><p>Hundreds of people liked the post with some dubbing Lisa a "rebel" and "cheeky". The mum added: "It will all be tongue and cheek. I've got a large following on Facebook through the show so they all know my personality. It was just something to make other people laugh and it gives other people tips on what to do."</p><p>A spokesperson for Manchester Airport said: "Our Escape Lounges have a smart/casual dress code, in-keeping with the experience and service they offer customers. We ask that customers dress appropriately for their visit and this means we do not permit certain items including, but not limited to, sports kits, pyjamas, fancy dress and hair rollers.</p><p>"Guests who arrive wearing items not permitted under the dress code will be asked to cover them up or remove them as appropriate. If they decline they may not be allowed entry to the lounge. Hair rollers are permitted in other parts of Manchester Airport, along with sportswear, pyjamas, and fancy dress."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6tqZqulaF6r7HWrGamrZ1ir7OtxqxkraqZmLiqusZmoaiao6y8s8DHZpiiqqCkv7V5kmpna2tiZ4Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ji-min-han.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Han Ji-min dating?

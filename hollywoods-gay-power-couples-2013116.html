In January 2019, Paulson opened up about how her relationship with the Two and a Half Men alum began.</p><p>“We met a very, very long time ago,” Paulson said on<a href=#> Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a>, joking that Taylor slid into her DMs. “I was with someone else … and then there was, like, a Twitter thing that happened. We were doing a thing at Martha Plimpton’s house, it was for an organization that she was working with, and we were both doing a PSA for it. We sort of breezed by one another and started following each other on Twitter.”</p><p>Since taking her relationship with Taylor public, Paulson has been candid about <a href=#>her “unconventional” personal life</a> with the Emmy winner, who is 32 years her senior.</p><p>“I do not want to be defined by who I share my bed, my home, my soul with,” she told <a href=#>Town & Country</a> in 2018. “My choices in life have been unconventional, and that’s my business. But I do want to live responsibly and truthfully without hiding. It’s complicated, because there is a lot of hate in this world, and a lot of good can come from quote-unquote <a href=#>normalizing something for people</a> who don’t see it as normal.”</p><p>The Ocean’s Eight actress added: “Our relationship represents a certain amount of hope and risk. Maybe there’s something brave in it. Maybe it encourages others to make brave choices. What else can I say? We love each other.”</p><p>For John and Furnish, who have <a href=#>been together since 1993</a>, it was important to remain individuals even as they became such an iconic couple. The pair finally tied the knot in December 2014, after same-sex marriage was legalized in the U.K., and share two sons, <a href=#>Zachary and Elijah</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s very important in any relationship that one partner doesn’t lose themselves in the other, and that’s very easy if you’re involved with a celebrity,” Furnish told the <a href=#>Observer</a> in 2001. “They get so much attention and so much deference anyway, it would be very easy to just get swept up into being their other half. I had my own career, my own identity. The worst thing I could do was sacrifice that.”</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Hollywood’s gay power couples:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktbC4y7KuqKeUqHqordhmp6ivlad6pLvUqaOeq11nfXJ%2FkGptaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bowers-pitsea-fc-22-football-club-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Bowers &amp;amp; Pitsea FC: 22 Football Club Facts</span></a>

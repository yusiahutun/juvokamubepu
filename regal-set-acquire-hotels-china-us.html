It previously announced it would open the Regal Shanghai East Asia Hotel in October.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This five-star, 350-room hotel will be part of the integrated Shanghai Sports Centre, which also features a convention centre and sports centre surrounding a stadium which will seat 80,000.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The sports centre is to open in October, when it will host the All National Games.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'We are working hard in Shanghai because it's one of the gateway cities that we will expand in,' Mr Lo said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Just like in Hong Kong, where we have four hotels and are building a fifth one - and there may be more - Shanghai we see as a metropolitan city that can afford to have more of our hotels.' Regal's largest source of earnings geographically is the US, where it has 27 hotels under management. The US operations accounted for 50 per cent of its turnover, or about $1.7 billion, in its last financial year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Regal decided last year to call off the separate flotation of its US hotels because it had no urgent need to raise the cash.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr Lo said the company had been 'chased by merchant bankers' keen to go ahead with the flotation, which had been expected to raise US$200 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'It's always on our minds whether it's a good time to do it,' Mr Lo said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Regal would buy more than one new hotel in the US this year. 'It is on our agenda to expand our portfolio of quality acquisitions at the right price,' he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The next purchase was likely to be in New York, a city Regal had been eyeing for a number of years. 'Negotiations are at an advanced stage and we are hopeful of an announcement of an acquisition soon,' Mr Lo said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Atlanta and San Francisco are other gateway cities in which the company is interested.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, Regal added the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles and the Bostonian Hotel in Boston to its US portfolio.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Closer to home, Mr Lo said the company had not decided on the fate of the Regal Airport Hotel, despite the scheduled closure of the adjacent Kai Tak airport next year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Apart from being an airport hotel, it's built itself up as more of a regional hotel in that area,' he said. 'There are lots of offices and industries in that area and lots of activities in Kowloon East and it's almost the only hotel in that area.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'We have to see what will happen to the whole area before we assess the future prospects of the hotel.' Hong Kong has four Regal hotels and is building its fifth at Chek Lap Kok airport. It also has expressed an interest in developing the hotel project at the Tai Kok Tsui MTR station.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr Lo said this did not necessarily spell the end of its hotel ventures in the territory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'We'd probably be interested in any large hotel project in Hong Kong in strategic locations that would be complementary to our existing portfolio,' he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Regal reported a 36.3 per cent surge in net profit to $525.5 million for the year to December. A consensus of analysts had expected a rise of just 17 per cent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdhboF2hI9oqZ6fkaF6tLHTZpicqaWev6Z5x6irnqSjYrCptc2aZK6r</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-blue-turns-to-grey-by-the-rolling-stones.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Blue Turns to Grey by The Rolling Stones</span></a>

"Think a Little Less" finds the singer returning to his romantic ways.</p><p>Ray sings of an irresistible spark on the third single from his self-titled album. Thus far he's scored a No. 1 hit with "Kiss You in&nbsp;the Morning" and a Top 20 with "Real Men Love Jesus," a spiritual ballad that offered a little more depth than much of his debut on Warner Music Nashville. "Think a Little Less"&nbsp;is built upon a sturdy chorus that is sure to get stuck in your head for an hour or a few.</p><p>Scott Hendricks' middle-of-the-road production keeps Ray firmly planted in the country genre, although the guitars lean into his rock side. This is another chance to showcase the singer as a talented vocalist and storyteller, and he embraces the opportunity with a convincing lyric that paints multi-sensory images.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong>:&nbsp;"Think a Little Less" was written by <a href=#>Thomas Rhett</a>, with Barry Dean, Jon Nite and Jimmy Robbins.</p><p><strong>Listen to Michael Ray, "Think a Little Less"</strong></p><p><h3>Michael Ray, "Think a Little Less" Lyrics:</h3></p><p>“Midnight's creepin' in, we know better / Than leaving here together / And in case you were wondering / You've never looked hotter / So why even bother / Looking at the reasons not to / Maybe we ought to.”</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>“Kiss a little more, think a little less / Burning up the night like a cigarette / And get you out of this bar, out of that dress / And kiss a little more / And kiss a little more, think a little less.”</p><p>“When your friends start asking you / Look 'em in the eyes / Tell a white lie / How I dropped you off at home and I walked you to the door / Nothing more / Tomorrow you can say we're just friends / But baby ‘til then.”</p><p>“I’ll go warm up the truck if you wanna hop in / Give you a minute or two / To say goodbye to your friends / Ain't gotta go home / But we gotta get gone / Cause we've already waited way too long to…”</p><p>“Kiss a little more / Think a little less / And do the only thing we've been thinking ‘bout doing since the moment, girl, we met.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpqGTna6muIyrmLJlpJ22r7eMmmSloaSpuaZ5y56qrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./18-best-fun-facts-about-deers.html><span>←</span><span>18 Best Fun Facts About Deers</span></a>

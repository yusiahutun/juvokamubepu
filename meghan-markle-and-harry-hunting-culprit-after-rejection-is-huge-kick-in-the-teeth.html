An insider says they are apparently ‘tracking down a Hollywood enemy’ who allegedly orchestrated a hate campaign against them.</strong></p><p>The Sussexes stepped away from the royal family three years ago. However, they still remain one of the most talked about people in the world. Since moving to California, the couple undertook many ventures together. Releasing their <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary, and inking a deal with Spotify are namely some of their biggest ventures. However, it has not been smooth sailing for the two. Their $20 million <a href=#>Spotify</a> deal reportedly ended in June this year, and the news got everyone talking. Now, a new report claims <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Prince Harry are ‘stinging with rejection’ over not being nominated for an Emmy.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/07/GettyImages-1054546696-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-are-stinging-with-rejection>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are ‘stinging with rejection’</h2><p><a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan’s Netflix documentary’s first episode had a viewership of 2.4 million. It was the highest single-day viewership any show received on the OTT platform. This was since the company partnered with rating body Barb in October 2022. However, despite their <a href=#>TV</a> documentary’s massive success, the Sussexes did not receive an Emmy nomination this year.</p><p>Now, a source close to the couple told Heat Magazine (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per</a> The Mirror) that Harry and Meghan are “stinging at the rejection, big time.” The source claimed they are “convinced” that someone has orchestrated a “hate campaign” against them in Hollywood which caused the <a href=#>Emmys</a> snub.</p><p>“The fact that they didn’t get an Emmy nod is a huge kick in the teeth,” the source reportedly told Heat.</p><p>The source reportedly further said the couple believes someone is trying to score “brownie points with the British royals,” by sabotaging them.</p><p><strong>Celebrity Tidbit and GRV Media have reached out to Harry and Meghan’s representatives for comment on the above claims.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/07/GettyImages-853710324-1024x684.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Sussexes are determined to weed out their Hollywood enemy</h2><p>The source further claims the former <a href=#>royals</a> want to track down those tarnishing their image in Hollywood. “It makes them sick and they’re looking to weed out these people one by one”.</p><p>They added, Harry and Meghan went on a “full inquest” to find out who caused their Emmy snub. The couple’s show did not make the cut into any categories this year of the prestigious awards.</p><p>However, all has not been grim for the couple. Their show bagged another major nomination.</p><p>The Sussexes’ much-needed morale boost came when their show was nominated for a Hollywood Critics Association&nbsp;TV&nbsp;Award recently. The show received a nomination in the “Best Streaming Nonfiction Series.”</p><p>However, their six-part series is facing off against some of the biggest non-fiction shows that came out this year. Their fellow nominees are Jeremy Renner’s Rennervations, Apple TV’s Prehistoric Planet, Eugene Levy’s The Reluctant Traveler and Disney’s The 1619 Project, and Rainn Wilson’s Geography of Bliss.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlvX2eEcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kmqaUYrWivtGyZKGtnqm2r7OMnKylqKKewW6txa2cq2Wimremr9Oipqdlmah6qcHGnmSkoZOgeqq6jK2fnmWkmrK1tI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jujutsu-kaisen-what-is-miguels-cursed-technique-in-the-manga-explained-1292524.html><span>←</span><span>Jujutsu Kaisen: What Is Miguels Cursed Technique In The Manga?

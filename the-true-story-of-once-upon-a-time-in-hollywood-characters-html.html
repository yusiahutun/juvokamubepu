He takes a piece of history that’s captured his imagination, creates a <a href=#>Mary Sue</a> or two to beat the boogeymen at the boss level, and poof! His avenging avatars kill Hitler, save Sharon Tate, and burn down one more plantation blighting the earth. Like Inglourious Basterds before it, Tarantino populates his ninth film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, with real figures alongside more reality-adjacent ones. So for those of us (all of us) less versed in his brand of fanboy ephemera, here’s a map to the stars, real and pretend, in OUATIH.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt0nt3i001j3a66yv7y0dvi@published>Rick Dalton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/304/9ae/55f66adcee13bb7e12f77b566c87824af1-01-ouatih-characters-real-life-lede.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Leo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton (left) versus ’60s-era actor Ty Hardin (right).<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt0nt6a001n3a66mx16211k@published data-word-count=62>Tarantino didn’t base Leo DiCaprio’s washed-up matinee cowboy Rick Dalton on any one actor, but the director has <a href=#>cited</a> inspiration from ’60s-era actors like Ty Hardin, whose career has shades of Dalton: Hardin went from starring in a TV show called Bronco to late-career Spaghetti Westerns.

Like Booth, Needham served in the Army before pivoting to stunt work, and met his professional partner on a black-and-white TV Western (Reynolds’s Riverboat).&nbsp;Needham and Reynolds even lived together for five years. Needham went on to write and direct Smokey and the Bandit and direct Cannonball Run.

For one, <a href=#>Serenity</a> already gave 2019 moviegoers the Citizen Kane of fishing-boat murders. For another, the whispers and ambiguity surrounding the circumstances of Mrs. Booth’s death echo the eternal Hollywood mystery of Natalie Wood’s passing, off a boat near Catalina Island in 1981. An L.A.

Tate really did train with Bruce Lee and sustain relationships with Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, and Wojciech Frykowski. Tate also really did have lunch on the day before she was killed, with her friend Joanna Pettet (Rumer Willis), who retired from acting in the ’90s.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt1mx4m00403a66dlb6y565@published>Jay Sebring</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt1njfd00473a66q9xuw2oz@published data-word-count=91>Steve McQueen got a lot of it right at that Playboy Mansion scene: Jay Sebring (played by Emile Hirsch) did indeed date Tate until she met Polanski on the London set of The Fearless Vampire Killers in 1966. The real-life McQueen, along with Bruce Lee, were both close friends of Sebring’s and clients at his salon. Sebring remained close with Tate, befriended Polanski and Frykowski, and had been involved with their mutual friend Abigail Folger. Sebring’s legacy lived on in Hollywood as the <a href=#>inspiration</a> for Warren Beatty’s hairdresser character in Shampoo.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt4d03c006e3a66eksdkrtb@published>Bruce Lee</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0a8/8cc/f71d94420d52228a4139537a31c6e31168-margot-robbie-sharon-tate.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Mike Moh as Bruce Lee (left) versus the real Bruce Lee (right).<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt4dahl006j3a66g1i8vlf8@published data-word-count=109>Cliff’s rooftop flashback shows Bruce Lee (Mike Moh, wearing the Kato jacket) behind the scenes of The Green Hornet, which aired for one season in the mid-1960s. What the scene <a href=#>doesn’t show</a> is that Sebring, an amateur karate enthusiast, had seen Lee at an event in 1964 and is the one who first recommended him to Hollywood producers. And as shown in Tate’s flashback, Lee’s first Hollywood movie gig was as the “karate adviser” for her scene in The Wrecking Crew. Lee would go on to become one of the most iconic action stars of the 1970s before passing away suddenly at the young age of 32 in 1973.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt2dv65004e3a660g3kvb8h@published>Wojciech Frykowski</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt2ehe7004l3a66szn3zvyh@published data-word-count=37>Wojciech (stylized Voytek in English) Frykowski (played by Costa Ronin) was an old friend of Polanski’s and was also involved with Abigail Folger.

Hullabaloo was in fact a real program on NBC that had the misfortune of being slotted as counterprogramming to the much more popular American Bandstand. The Mamas and the Papas — who we see partying with Tate at the Playboy Mansion — <a href=#>made an appearance</a> on the series in 1966. Those pigtailed Hullabaloo Dancers we see twisting with Rick Dalton had some surprising careers beyond this two-season oddity: One of the show’s go-go girls, Lana St. Edmund, went on to become the highest paid Hollywood stunt woman of all time.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt0ntb3001v3a66mthafl71@published>Steve McQueen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2e7/6cb/5d13f2b8e58e5aa714f8818e73b6934a9b-hubaloo.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen (left) versus the real Steve McQueen (right).<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt0ntd9001z3a66d75l7qb9@published data-word-count=89>McQueen, who will henceforth be known as the guy who robbed Rick Dalton of that Great Escape gig, did many of his own stunts, but he was also one of the first major action stars to <a href=#>publicly credit his stunt double</a>. In real life, McQueen passed on an invitation to a party at Tate’s house on the night of the murders, and it was later reported that his name was on Manson’s hit list. McQueen had a persistent cough (not unlike Dalton’s) that led to a fatal mesothelioma diagnosis.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt0ntc6001x3a66tcxwh6nh@published>James Stacy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fc4/7c0/d30363d69ff83ea0f52696b33f0104555e-damian-lewis-steve-mcqueen.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Timothy Olyphant as James Stacey (left) versus the real James Stacey (right).<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt0ntec00203a66z066vovb@published data-word-count=83>The TV cowboy played by Timothy Olyphant really did star as one of three Lancer family gunslingers on the 1960s Western series Lancer. Fitting with the hinting references to mythical Hollywood tragedies that hang over OUATIH, the real-life Stacy had his left arm and leg amputated after suffering a motorcycle accident in 1973, not long after the events of Tarantino’s film. (In Once Upon a Time, Olyphant’s character drives a motorcycle off set.) Stacy died from an anaphylactic reaction to antibiotics in 2016.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt0ntd7001y3a66ekxwtna2@published>Wayne Maunder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8f2/0ab/3565fb66d0c8a43a3e0652fb06c971265a-timothy-olyphant-james-stacy.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Luke Perry as Wayne Maunder (left) versus the real Wayne Maunder (right).<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt0ntfi00223a660412gj03@published data-word-count=97>A blond Luke Perry briefly appears as actor Wayne Maunder, who really did play the flashier Lancer (that leopard print!) on Lancer. The actor went on to do stints on other OUATIH-featured series, including The FBI. Curiously, Maunder only acted in two films, one being the Manson-tinged Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, by pulp king Russ Meyer. Not only does the original 1967 Dolls get a mention for Sharon Tate’s performance in the film, but Tarantino referenced Meyer’s Faster, Pussycat, Kill! Kill! in his film Death Proof, and of course, named a character Pussycat in OUATIH.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt0ntek00213a66qnzgktr5@published>Trudi Fraser/Mirabella Lancer</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt0ntgs00253a664qbk9pe3@published data-word-count=121>“Johnny gets more than he bargained for when he goes after a horse trader who cheated him and ends up taking care of the trader’s feisty 10-year-old niece.” That’s the IMDb plot description for a 1968 episode of Lancer called “The Heart of Pony Alice,” and it’s the closest thing in the show’s history to the episode we see in OUATIH (featuring <a href=#>Julia Butters</a> as Trudi Fraser as Mirabella Lancer). The feisty 10-year-old in question was played by Eve Plumb, although it’s unclear if she applied Trudi’s rigorous commitment to her craft on the set of The Brady Bunch. <a href=#>Others have suggested</a> that Trudi may be an avatar for a young Jodie Foster, who made guest appearances on shows like Gunsmoke.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt0ntfn00233a66slhf58d6@published>Sam Wanamaker</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt0ntin00273a66fn5y712n@published data-word-count=83>Nicholas Hammond plays the actor turned director who insists on that floppy mustache for Leo on Lancer (great call, by the way) and likens the Dalton role to Hamlet. The year after the events of OUATIH, the real Wanamaker made it his life’s mission to restore Shakespeare’s original Globe to a working theater. His foundation raised millions for the project by the time he passed away in 1993, and he is <a href=#>still credited</a> in England with leading the charge for restoring the icon.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt0ntge00243a66xi88c5ur@published>Pussycat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/81a/84d/050ed8dda153fda6f070f31cabde174b72-luke-perry-wayne-maunder.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Margaret Qualley as Pussycat (left) versus the real Pussycat (right).<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt0ntjd00293a66a19nk5mh@published data-word-count=59>Margaret Qualley’s <a href=#>hitchhiking Manson girl</a> is probably a composite rather than a direct historical figure.

She had a son with Manson family member “Clem” Grogan, who you’ll know as the character Cliff punches out on the ranch in the film.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt396zf00563a66sd34e2ui@published>George Spahn</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt39i8p005d3a66duf2rfli@published data-word-count=68>Bruce Dern plays the old, incapacitated owner of Spahn ranch, who in reality really did rent it out to the Manson family in exchange for sexual favors with the women.

Terry Melcher, a record producer and Doris Day’s son, had previously passed on recording Manson’s music. He went on to win a Golden Globe for writing “Kokomo.” The “Candi” in question was his then-girlfriend Candice Bergen, who has never spoken about the murders.

While there’s no record of a female stunt coordinator on the original Green Hornet TV series, Bell has worked as a stunt double in Tarantino’s films since Kill Bill: Vol. 1, and was the stunt coordinator on OUATIH. Meanwhile, Kurt Russell’s stunt-coordinator character does not appear to line up with any one Hollywood figure in particular, but <a href=#>Tarantino notes</a> that Kurt Russell helped him keep the Lancer scenes period-authentic, as the son of a Western character actor (Bing Russell) who himself starred in the 1963 TV Western The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt3kybs005p3a66n56kwkcf@published>Marvin Schwarzs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ae8/5d5/0afb2348f9d43571d3bd105fbdf41ba90e-lena-dunham-gypsy.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Al Pacino’s Marvin Schwarz (right).<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt3llnc005v3a66cppjwy34@published data-word-count=43>Al Pacino’s colorful Hollywood-agent character doesn’t have an immediately identifiable real-life counterpart, although real-life producer Marvin Schwarz, who worked on shoot-em-ups with Kirk Douglas, Burt Reynolds, and Rock Hudson in the ’60s and ’70s, may have given Tarantino the idea for the name.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyt46wwn00643a66h7mllhp5@published>Francesca Cappucci</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/995/2f0/c7a7f896ee70eddf6a148f8bb5e66a14f5-al-pacino.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Claudia Cardinale.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyt47gsw00693a66fazgbvrg@published data-word-count=47>Chilean actress Lorenza Izzo <a href=#>says</a> that she based her portrayal of Rick Dalton’s wife on actresses like Sophia Loren, Claudia Cardinale, and Virna Lisi, all of whom became well-known Stateside in the 1960s.

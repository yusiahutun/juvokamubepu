It’s a great time to look back at the President’s former television appearances, including his memorable time on&nbsp;<a href=#>Law & Order: SVU</a>&nbsp;in a guest role as himself. What did Biden say during the episode? We have all the details about the situation.</p><h2 id=h-joe-biden-was-once-in-season-18-episode-2-of-law-order-svu>Joe Biden was once in Season 18, Episode 2 of ‘Law & Order: SVU’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mariska-Hargitay-and-Joe-Biden-in-SVU.jpg><p id=par-2_55>In season 18, episode 2 of <a href=#>SVU</a>, Joe Biden, was then the Vice President of the United States under President Barack Obama. The episode in question, titled “Making a Rapist,” is actually inspired by Netflix’s&nbsp;Making a Murderer, and Biden appears in the beginning of the episode as he talks to law enforcement and the media.</p><p id=par-3_93>“My dad used to have an expression,” Biden says as he speaks to the police department. “He said, ‘The greatest sin any person can commit is the abuse of power. And the greatest abuse of power was rape. It takes a woman a long time to heal. When the victim isn’t believed, when she goes through the invasive process of having a rape kit put together, and then it’s stuck on a shelf somewhere. And then the rape kit is never ever tested. We fail. We fail her. We fail so many women.”</p><p id=par-4_44>Biden stands beside Lieutenant Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) as he finishes his speech which is being broadcast on television. Law enforcement stand around Biden and Benson as the Vice President at the time talks at the podium about the backlog of untested rape kits.</p><p id=par-5_39>“I’m proud to say today we did not fail,” Biden explains. “Thanks to the dedicated efforts of law enforcement, the whole legal system, the victims’ advocacy groups, and in particularly, my friend here Lieutenant Olivia Benson of&nbsp;SVU. Congratulations Lieutenant.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-making-a-rapist>‘Making a Rapist’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_60>Biden shakes Benson’s hand, and she thanks him and announces that they cleared the name of Sean Roberts (Henry Thomas) who was convicted of sexual assault more than a decade prior. An untested rape kit leads to the discovery of the real person who assaulted the victim, and Sean is set free after years of sexual assault while in prison.</p><p id=par-7_49>However, Sean is then accused of brutally assaulting, maiming, and ultimately killing the original victim Melanie Harper’s (Kelli Williams) daughter, Ashley (Alexis Collins). Her engagement ring is found in the drain in his home along with blood on his shoes. The detectives arrest Sean and put him on trial.</p><p id=par-8_82>There are issues with a witness’ testimony and his affection for Detective Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish), as well as the victim’s mother initially backtracking about hearing Sean’s voice the night of the murder. But Sean does eventually admit to assaulting and killing Ashley after taking a plea deal to serve 15 years in prison. It’s a shocking turn of events, and Shaun says it “just happened” in court. The episode is a difficult one all around, and it truly affects the detectives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3sLGMm6CdnZ5ixKK%2FjKilnJ1dnrturc1mnKmho6SxpnnOn2SlmadivLOwxKtkrK6lYsSprdNmsKitXaOyprCMraZmo56kxG6twaisrWWZqXupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./footballer-retired-young-wag-romario.html><span>←</span><span>Retired footballers who dated younger Wags, from Romario to David Ginola to David Seaman, Ian Rush a</span></a>

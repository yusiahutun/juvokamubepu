Having lived in New York my whole life, I’d like to think I’ve become an expert at staying warm — and that includes finding the <a href=#>warmest winter coats for women</a>. But it’s not just my location that makes me a pro on this topic. I’ve also worked in fashion for over 10 years, and have written and styled multiple stories involving quality <a href=#>outerwear</a>. I’ve touched and tried on a million options, and know a good coat when it see one.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>My own winter coat collection is constantly growing. Each year, I add around three different styles to my closet, having been tempted by sales and gift cards or gifted arctic-approved options from my parents (my dad is also obsessed with finding the warmest winter <a href=# id=auto-tag_coats data-tag=coats>coats</a>). It’s admittedly become my thing, and while I tell myself I don’t need another <a href=#>insulated puffer</a> or faux fur trench, I can’t help but hand over my credit card.</p><p>Throughout the years, I’ve put plenty of those so-called best winter coats through literal tests. I’ve reviewed different designs for stories — both affordable options and luxury picks — and once styled a coat story featuring women who work outside. It’s allowed me to really weigh the pros and cons on what’s worth buying, and also compile an extensive list of my favorites. Check out the best winter coats for women — according to a lifelong New Yorker and a stylist — ahead.</p><p>Table Of Contents</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-the-warmest-coat-for-seniors>What to look for in a winter coat</h2><p>When it comes to what to look for in a winter coat, you should probably consider your location before shopping. Do you live in a place that gets so cold, a bulky, down-filled design is pretty much a necessity? Or can you get away with something lighter that’s lined with fleece? If snow is a concern, you might want to opt for a hood. Also, it doesn’t hurt to consider what you’ll wear it with — a sleek peacoat might pair better with dresses or office attire (although no one’s judging you put warmth above fashion and layer with a puffer).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-the-best-brand-of-winter-coat>What is the best brand of winter coat?</h2><p>The best brand of winter coat really depends on personal preference. Some classics include Lands’ End, Canada Goose, and The North Face, but in recent years, Aritzia and even Amazon have become go-tos for shopping warm winter coats for women.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-best-women-s-winter-coats-at-a-glance>The Best Women’s Winter Coats, at a Glance</h2><ul><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lands’ End Women’s Down Winter Coat</a>, $179.96</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Bernardo Hooded Water Resistant Puffer Jacket</a>, $99.99</li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Canada Goose Trillium Parka Heritage</a>, $1,650</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Stand Studio Camille Long Faux Fur Cocoon Coat</a>, $475</li><li><a data-pmc-sp-product=4e29a772230a46d175610f4c6259dbba href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Orolay Women’s Thickened Down Jacket","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Orolay Women&#39;s Thickened Down Jacket Red X-Small","price":"89.99","id":"B07WNGPZF6","category":"Down Jackets & Parkas"},"id":1173202,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Orolay Women’s Thickened Down Jacket</a> , $151.99</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The North Face 1996 Retro Nuptse Jacket</a>, $330</li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alo Oversized Faux Fur Trench</a>, $398</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>J.Crew New Lady Day Topcoat in Italian Double-Cloth Wool Blend</a>, $299.50</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Avec Les Filles Faux Leather Jacket</a>, $229</li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mango Women’s Leather-Effect Trench Coat</a>, 179.99</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Garage Perfect Puff</a>, $99.95</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1-lands-end-women-s-down-winter-coat>1.

This one also comes complete with snap storm flap that will help to block “wind and wet,” so you’ll have some extra protection should you encounter a snow storm. Plus, you can get it from Walmart!</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: If you’re looking for something with flair, this isn’t it. Aside from some bright color options, this winter coat is super simple and puts practicality over anything else. And, while it’ll protect you from 0° temperatures, anything below that might have you feeling the cold.</li></ul><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$179.96</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>239.95</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>25% Off</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2-bernardo-hooded-water-resistant-puffer-jacket>2.

Plus, the recycled-polyester insulation is GRS (Global Recycled Standard) certified and bluesign® approved.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: This thing is warm — almost too warm to wear on more mild winter days (you’ll be sweating).</li></ul><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$99.99</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>180</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>44% Off</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3-canada-goose-trillium-parka-heritage>3.

It even has fleece-lined pockets, which are perfect for keeping you hands warm. And, you can forget looking like a lumpy marshmallow this season; simply cinch and adjust the waist via an interior drawcord to create a more customized fit.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: Even though Canada Goose promises to protect wearers from Arctic-like weather conditions, this one isn’t its warmest option and can only endure up to -13° F (although that’s still impressive, IMO).</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4-stand-studio-camille-long-faux-fur-cocoon-coat>4.

It’s definitely a statement-making, celeb-worthy layer (I’ve gotten tons of compliments while wearing it!), but still pairs perfectly with casual jeans.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: The size range is disappointing and what is available is already selling out.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5-orolay-women-s-thickened-down-jacket>5.

When I first tried it on for a photo shoot, I was super impressed by how warm it felt, thanks to the fleece lining, and love the cool zipper details.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: While it’s definitely a deal, it isn’t exactly cheap, and you’ll likely be shivering if you rock it during a snow storm.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6-the-north-face-1996-retro-nuptse-jacket>6. The North Face 1996 Retro Nuptse Jacket</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-North-Face.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Sizing available:</strong> X-Small – XX-Large</li><li><strong>Colors available:</strong> 8</li><li><strong>Material:</strong> 100% recycled nylon or 100% polyester</li><li><strong>Insulation:</strong> 700-fill-power down</li><li><strong>Waterproof:</strong> No</li><li><strong>Length:</strong> Short</li><li><strong>Hood:</strong> Hidden zip-out hood</li><li><strong>Lining:</strong> 100% nylon insulation</li><li><strong>Best for:</strong> Those who are nostalgic and/or enjoy ’90s style.</li><li><strong>Pros:</strong> Despite being a simple black puffer, it still feels unique and cool — probably because this style was the “It” item from a few decades ago (I’m a millennial and had one in high school). Celebrities like Jennifer Aniston and Emily Ratajkowski both enjoy this pick from The North Face, so you’ll be able to nail the Hollywood look for under $500.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: The main complaint is that this coat is too puffy and gives off Michelin Man vibes.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7-alo-oversized-faux-fur-trench>7. Alo Oversized Faux Fur Trench</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alo.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Sizing available:</strong> XXS – L</li><li><strong>Colors available:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Material:</strong> 100% Polyester</li><li><strong>Insulation:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Waterproof:</strong> No</li><li><strong>Length:</strong> Full length, mid-calf</li><li><strong>Hood:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Lining:</strong> “Satiny” interior lining</li><li><strong>Best for:</strong> Someone who enjoys the look of a luxe fur coat, but doesn’t want to spend thousands of dollars.</li><li><strong>Pros:</strong> Reviewers claim this winter coat makes them feel like a billionaire, and the fact that it’s faux fur will save you from feeling guilty whenever you slip it on. It’s also super plush and cozy, and I’ve definitely felt tempted to wear it around the house with my pajamas.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: This coat runs large, so size down if you want something that looks more form-fitting — and even then, it may still be oversized. You also won’t be able to find any zippers, buttons, or belts included. It’s meant to be worn open, which is kind of annoying when you’re feeling cold.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8-j-crew-new-lady-day-topcoat-in-italian-double-cloth-wool-blend>8.

Now, you can have a form-fitting, (mostly) wool top coat that actually blocks out the biting winter wind and save you from shivering in below-zero weather.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: If you look at the comments, people seem to prefer previous versions, which were 100% and, apparently, better quality.</li></ul><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$299.50</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>398</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>25% Off</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9-avec-les-filles-faux-leather-jacket>9.

I love the buckle and big collar. It’s rugged yet polished, all at the same time.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: Some have complained that this coat weighs too much and feels heavy once they put it on. Others say it’s the big belt that annoys them, although that detail is easily removable.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=10-mango-women-s-leather-effect-trench-coat>10. Mango Women’s Leather-Effect Trench Coat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mango.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Sizing available:</strong> XXS – 1XL</li><li><strong>Colors available:</strong> 2</li><li><strong>Material:</strong> 100% Viscose with polyurethane coating</li><li><strong>Insulation:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Waterproof:</strong> No</li><li><strong>Length:</strong> Mid-length</li><li><strong>Hood:</strong> None</li><li><strong>Lining:</strong> 100% Polyester</li><li><strong>Best for:</strong> Not-too-cold, in-between Winter days.</li><li><strong>Pros:</strong> Not every winter day calls for fully-lined outerwear. This faux leather trench is just warm enough to keep your teeth from chattering on 50° F days, and is similar to styles beloved by the Jenners and Hailey Bieber — for a fraction of the price.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: Aside from a removable belt, there are also adjustable ties featured at the wrist, which can quickly become loose without you even realizing. I ended up losing one on a particularly hectic day running around the city, but the coat looks just as cute without it.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=11-garage-perfect-puff>11.

It’s warm enough for cold winter days and looks just like designer alternatives. Plus, you can pick it up from your local mall.</li><li><strong>Cons</strong>: It’s filled with polyester instead of quality down, and while other options can easily be thrown in the wash, this coat is dry clean only.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZ6Yra2imnyjsdKtZLCnnZq7tHnWoqWtnaJisLCt06xkamlnaH9xfo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ap-star-dolphins-receiver-tyreek-hill-will-miss-sundays-game-against-the-jets-with-an-ankle-injury.html><span>←</span><span>Star Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill will miss Sundays game against the Jets with an ankle injury</span></a>

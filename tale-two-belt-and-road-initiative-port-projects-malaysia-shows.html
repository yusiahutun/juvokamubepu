Both are what is known as “Port-Park-City” schemes, which aim to create spillover effects from their international ports for the benefit of proximate industrial estates or urban development initiatives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/12/07/0374bca8-3628-11eb-8d89-a7d6b31c4b8a_1320x770_121919.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kuantan Port – built in 1984 and originally operated by the federal government before being privatised in 1998 – is Malaysia’s closest port to China, with ships taking just three days to reach it from Beibu Gulf Port in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At present, the port is relatively small, ranking eighth nationally in terms of total cargo throughput, according to official figures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the Kuantan Port Consortium – majority owned by Malaysia’s IJM Corporation with Hong Kong’s Beibu Gulf Holding having a 40 per cent stake – plans to expand by constructing a new deep water terminal to service bigger vessels, with the total cost of the project estimated to be 3 billion ringgit (US$736.37 million), excluding the 1 billion ringgit breakwater being funded by the federal government.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s belt and road: from Malaysia to Philippines, projects face hurdles</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Until Najib lost power in the 2018 general elections, he had prioritised the Kuantan port project – along with the accompanying Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park.</p>Concerns that his favourable stance on Chinese investments would be reversed under his successor <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Mahathir Mohamad</span></a> failed to materialise, despite the latter’s criticisms of their size, funding structure and financial viability while on the campaign trail.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mahathir’s Pakatan Harapan government went on to indicate a positive outlook towards Chinese investment, even reinstating the controversial East Coast Rail Link after intensive renegotiations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/12/07/7d402f02-362f-11eb-8d89-a7d6b31c4b8a_1320x770_121919.jpg>A new administration under Prime Minister <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Muhyiddin Yassin</span></a>, which took power in March this year, has not changed its foreign policy stance as it has been too busy dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and stabilising the domestic political situation.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indeed, the new administration has continued flagship initiatives put in place during the</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pakatan Harapan period such as the China Special Channel, which looks to attract investments from companies seeking to relocate away from China amid its ongoing trade war with the US.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China-Malaysia industrial park project draws US$4.8 billion in investments</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thus both the Kuantan port project and accompanying park have received support, either overtly or tacitly, from the top political leaders of the day and the country’s economic elite.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the state government does not have a direct economic stake in Kuantan, it stands to benefit from the jobs created through the port’s expansion, as well as via economic spillovers. Furthermore, the state government does have a stake in the development of the Malaysia China Kuantan Industrial Park, which has a symbiotic relationship with the port.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Different story</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fate of the Melaka Gateway project – a 43 billion-ringgit (US$10.5 billion) facility encompassing four islands in the Malacca Strait that is slated to include Southeast Asia’s largest private marina, facilities for berthing four cruise ships simultaneously, cargo terminals, a maritime hi-tech park, and a free-trade zone – is a different story.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Marketed with references to Melaka’s glorious trading history and the multiple visits made to the port by Chinese Admiral Zheng He, the project was expected to revitalise the state’s economy and create some 40,000 or so jobs, as well as attracting 2.5 million visitors per year and generating 1.19 trillion ringgit annually for the state government’s coffers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Launched to much fanfare in 2014, the project was backed by the Najib government and led by property developer KAJ Development Berhad, with the support of Chinese state-owned enterprise PowerChina International and three provincial government-owned companies in Malaysia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It received high-profile visits in 2015 from members of the Guangdong provincial government, Malaysia and China’s transport ministers, and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">While China may provide the funds, [domestic] actors are the ones that provide resources, capital and an ability to navigate the local political context</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Given the project’s location and scale, analysts were quick to cast the Melaka Gateway in strategic terms, portraying it “as a means for China to acquire and sustain military-strategic influence in the Strait of Malacca”, as its location on Peninsular Malaysia’s west coast meant it could be linked up with the East Coast Rail Link and Kuantan Port to form a land bridge bypassing Singapore.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Furthermore, the Gateway would enable China to surveil the Strait, a conduit for up to 80 per cent of the country’sfuel needs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, despite the Gateway’s purported strategic imperatives and high-profile backing from powerful China-based central and provincial SOEs, in November the Melaka chief minister’s office said its agreement with KAJ on the 43 billion ringgit project had ended.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The developer failed to complete land reclamation works on schedule and would no longer be in charge of the project, the statement said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/12/07/9b2db4f6-3627-11eb-8d89-a7d6b31c4b8a_1320x770_121919.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An analysis of the circumstances surrounding this project show they were different from the Kuantan port expansion. Despite public declarations of support, the Najib administration did not invest any funds in the initiative.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Malaysia’s sovereign wealth funds or GLCs did not acquire stakes in the project and the Pakatan Harapan government was explicitly hostile to it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There may be several reasons for this lack of interest in the project among Malaysia’s national political elite. First, unlike Kuantan Port, Melaka Gateway is not one of the country’s seven federal ports, three of which are on the Peninsular West Coast.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, an in-depth World Bank review of the port sector recommended a more intensive use of existing facilities, as opposed to dispersing traffic across a number of ports. With sound planning, improved logistics connections and a careful increase in capacity, the review argued that the current network of priority ports would be able to cater to the country’s projected needs until 2040. Building more ports would cannibalise cargo handled at other ports, it said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Malaysia: PM Muhyiddin wins draft budget vote, overcoming leadership test</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Neither did the investment coalition behind the Melaka Gateway, led by PowerChina, have representation in the highest level of the political or economic elite. There was no participation by influential government-linked corporations active in the infrastructure sector such as the UEM Group or SP Setia, or, indeed, privately-owned conglomerates such as Gamuda or YTL Corporation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It had the backing of the local political elite and the state government, but this ended up being of limited use in Malaysia’s top heavy federal system. There was support of a local construction player (KAJD), but the challenge to the national economic elite that hold stakes in existing ports that would lose throughput cargo proved to be a bigger factor.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As these two examples show, domestic actors involved in BRI projects are a vital aspect of their failure or success. While China may provide the funds, these actors are the ones that provide resources, capital and an ability to navigate the local political context.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">This article was first published by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in November 2020, titled <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The BRI in Malaysia’s Port Sector: Drivers of Success and Failure</span></a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLyxtc2ipqdnkafBqq%2FLnmZsaWFng3eBjq2YpZ1dqcSwecGeo61lkaOxbr7OmptmoZ6ewaqt06KtnmWgpL%2B1ec%2BrpqOdk6nAbrnApZiyq5mWerS0zrCq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-bieber-nude-photos-selena-gomez.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Bieber Gets Candid On His Nude Photos, Reveals Which Songs He Wrote About Selena Gomez</span></a>

by Wang Dalu, who takes his life after falling prey to online gambling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Director Shen Ao told state news agency Xinhua that he was halfway through writing the script when he heard about a similar case to Tian’s and decided to include it in the story.</p><img

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The ripped-from-the-headlines plot reflects a broader concern in China about such scams.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the centres of such activity is northern Myanmar, an area beset by civil unrest on the border of China’s southwestern province of Yunnan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shanghai-based news outlet The Paper reported on Thursday that five people, four of them teens from Yunnan, were lured into Myanmar illegally and forced into scamming.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Qin said the scams were undermining the interests of the Chinese people and called for joint law enforcement in the area.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the meantime, China has given its agencies new power to pursue cyber fraud scammers and suspects abroad and some cities have threatened to freeze the bank accounts of those who fail to comply.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taiwanese actor Jim Liu, who plays a Jianan immigration officer in the movie, said the public were concerned about these kinds of crimes but had not really seen them explored in cinema.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No big commercial film had turned the topic into a plot-driven, action-packed film, with an aesthetic appeal<strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">,</strong> a cast with chemistry and an entertaining approach,” said Liu, whose character helps Chinese police crack down on the gangs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the movie encouraged viewers to understand the characters – whether victims or perpetrators – and reflect on their own choices, rather than condemn or blame others for temptations that many feel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The movie sought to evoke a sense of “shared vulnerability” and raise the hope that society might become more inclusive, saying it was important to understand the helplessness and shame of victims overseas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Factors like environment and culture can discourage people from speaking up, making them feel even more isolated and alone,” Liu said.</p><p class=postsid

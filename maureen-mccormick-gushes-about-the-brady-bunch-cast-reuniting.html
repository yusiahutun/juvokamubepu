I had gone to Utah and was hanging out with Michael Lookinland’s family. I mean I think the last time I had seen anyone before this was possibly at Chris Knight’s wedding that was here in California but it had been, I think at least 15 years since we had all been together on camera.”</p><p>Even though Maureen had a great time meeting up with most of her costars again, she admits she still misses her late friend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-aesra-score=linkNewWindowWarning:1;><strong>Florence Henderson</strong></a> who played Carol Brady on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_editorial_3615836a_huge.jpg><p>“The biggest life lessons I have learned, came from Florence, and that was, being able to find joy like in a big way,” she said to Closer in a <a href=#>separate interview</a>. “I mean, I spent a lot of time with her before she passed away. And I truly believe she taught me so much about finding joy and I feel such joy again in my life.”</p><p>We don’t know about you, but we can’t wait for A Very Brady Renovation to premiere on HGTV on Monday, September 9!</p><p>Be sure to check out and <a href=#>subscribe to our Classic TV & Film Podcast</a> for interviews with your favorite stars!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmK6qlZq7brnCnKarpZmYuG6z1Kyfnqtdlq%2BwwdNmq6GdXZe%2ForDYZpmuppOdeqSt0q1kq52lo7a1tc2gZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hawkeyes-lukas-van-ness-declares-for-the-nfl-draft.html><span>←</span><span>Hawkeyes Lukas Van Ness declares for the NFL draft</span></a>

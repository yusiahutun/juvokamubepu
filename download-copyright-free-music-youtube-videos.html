Instead, get free and royalty-free music from one of these sites.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you're hoping to be a viral sensation or just posting something for family and friends to see. If it's free for the public to see, the copyright owner of that music can make a claim and remove your video. And yes, YouTube is notorious for making your favorite videos disappear because of this.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>A better option is to use copyright-free or royalty-free music. It saves you from violating copyright restrictions. These free music download sites will give you great music choices. You just need to add a link to the source in your description.</p><h2 id=thematic>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thematic</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/free-royalty-free-youtube-music-thematic.png><p>Thematic is the service that most YouTube creators should be looking at for free songs from established artists and musicians. To get access, you'll need to become a member of Thematic, but you don't even need a credit card to sign up.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>After you've become a member, you'll get to see the full Thematic music catalog, which includes music from several unique artists. It also provides access to tracks from some fairly popular musicians.</p><p>Of course, there are some rules for the platform. Thematic members have to follow a particular attribution link and style to use the songs on YouTube or Instagram, and those are the only two platforms where you're allowed to show your video. But as long as you follow the requirements, you'll be able to download free music and use a professionally made song for your videos.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=unminus>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Unminus</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/uminus-royalty-free.png><p>Unminus is another website for free music downloads. This site is different from all the others here because the tracks come with a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license.</p><p>In case you don't know about <a href=#>Creative Commons licenses</a>, the CC0 license lets you use any work for free, in personal or commercial causes, edit it as you see fit, and without attribution. This means you can do whatever you want with the music on Unminus, and you don't have to add a link for it in the YouTube description or include it in any credits roll.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>New tracks are added to Unminus only once in a while. If you want to know the next time new material is available, subscribe to the newsletter for alerts.

Each has its sub-categories to further refine your choices and quickly find what you're looking for. You can stream any song in full before downloading it, and get information like runtime, visualizer, and so on.</p><p>Of course, there's a search function as well. But you're probably better off using the large number of tags on the site to browse and find free music to download for your YouTube video.</p><h2 id=teknoaxe>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TeknoAXE</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tekno-royalty-free.png><p>For many years now, musician and YouTuber TeknoAXE has been making songs and scores, becoming a great source to download free music because anyone on the internet can use it for free.

In exchange, you get a collection of almost 1,500 songs spread across several genres, and even moods like comedy, drama, horror, and so on.</p><p>Listen to a few tracks, and you might think, "Hey, I've heard this before".

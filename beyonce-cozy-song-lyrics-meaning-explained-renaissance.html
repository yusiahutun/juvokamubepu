"There has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it," it read, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/celebrity/beyonc-jay-z-and-solange-break-silence-about-video-drama/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>.

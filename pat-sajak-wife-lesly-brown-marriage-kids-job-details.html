The iconic game show star’s longtime wife, </span><b>Lesly Brown</b><span>, has been by his side throughout the majority of his run in showbiz. She remained his biggest supporter when he announced he <a href=#>would be leaving the program</a> after season 41. <strong>Scroll below to get to know more about Pat’s wife.&nbsp;</strong></span></p><h2><b>When Did Pat Sajak Marry His Wife, Lesly Brown?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>The TV personality had been married once before to his ex-wife,</span><b> Sherrill Sajack</b><span>, from 1979 to 1986. Pat and Lesly met for the first time in 1988 through mutual friends in California. Even though Pat is 18 years her senior, it didn’t take long at all for the two to fall in love. After nearly a year of dating, Pat and Lesly got married in 1989.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It is frightening,” the Emmy winner told </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span> of their strong connection after their nuptials. “We are already doing the thing where you start a sentence, and the other person finishes it for you.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pat-sajak-and-wife-lesly-browns-cutest-photos-then-and-now10.jpg><p><span>Fast-forward to today, and the couple have been married for more than 30 years and share <a href=#>two kids</a>. They welcomed their eldest son, </span><b>Patrick Sajak Jr.</b><span>, in September 1990, and their daughter,</span> <a href=#><b>Maggie Sajak</b></a><span>, nearly five years later in January 1995.</span></p><h2><b>What Is Lesly Brown’s Job?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Lesly was born on February 18, 1965, to her parents, Michael Brown and Maria Brown. She wasn’t an only child though, as she grew up alongside her two sisters, Wendy and Kelly. While her future husband ended up on our TV screens every weekday for years, Lesly went on to get a bachelor’s degree in television production from the University of Maryland in 1986.</span></p><p><span>Aside from TV production, Lesly was also interested in a modeling career and found herself in various competitions. She was even once crowned “Miss Georgetown.” However, she soon retired from her modeling dreams to pursue another bachelor’s degree. “I left modeling to become a professional law practitioner,” she once told</span><a href=#> <i><span>People</span></i></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Later on, Lesly became quite a famous photographer, which is what she mostly focuses on today. She does have a degree in TV production, so it should come as no surprise that the beauty has actually graced the small screen a couple of times. According to</span><a href=#> <span>IMDb</span></a><span>, the mom of two has appeared on </span><i><span>Wheel of Fortune</span></i><span> alongside Pat on a few occasions. She was also a spokesperson for Sandals Emerald Bay in 2012.</span></p><p><span>Lesly and Pat continue to be strong and happy in their lasting marriage. The pair own a home in Severna Park, Maryland, with a second property in Los Angeles. In June 2023, Pat announced he was leaving Wheel of Fortune.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Well, the time has come. I’ve decided that our 41st season, which begins in September, will be my last. It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ll have more to say in the coming months. Many thanks to you all,” the beloved TV star told </span><i><span>Closer</span></i><span> in a statement.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46pmK1lo5a3oreMsKCfnV2hsrS42GaZq6eno3qurdGroJqflWK4qrDSZqGoml2ZsrWtyKWqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megan-fox-lists-all-the-plastic-surgery-shes-had-but-refuses-to-disclose-hidden-op.html><span>←</span><span>Megan Fox lists all the plastic surgery she's had but refuses to disclose 'hidden' op</span></a>

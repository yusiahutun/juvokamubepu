It was women living on the land who initially adopted the cheap, practical dress, whose name derives from a dialect term that can also mean “girl”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But by the end of the 19th century, it was also being worn by women at the imperial court when they flocked to the countryside in summer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Everything was very corseted in Vienna,” Weissengruber said. “On holiday they were able to free themselves, with these lighter, brighter styles,” she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/08/12/2ee609fd-192d-42e6-a570-3665bf7a54a5_87885aa2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hosted in the Marmorschloessl, the “cottage” given to Sissi by her husband, the exhibition shows how the dirndl has evolved through some 50 examples.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The early, no-frills versions quickly give way to more elaborate outfits fit for those seeking an audience at the imperial villa. Angelika Schauer runs a family dirndl-makers in Bad Ischl that traces its history back to 1895. She recalls that her grandfather counted visitors at court among his clients.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When he was taking measurements he was under close watch” from the bodyguards who came with the well-heeled clients, she said. “He had to refrain from making certain movements.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/08/12/f1939cb6-f54a-4959-88a5-ac13c75a1e7d_58dda525.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the Nazi period, while women were encouraged to wear similar traditional dress, the word “dirndl” itself was banned, the regime finding it too redolent of the “Jewish-run” clothing industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the dirndl never disappeared, with the patrons of the prestigious Salzburg Festival having sported it from the 1920s onwards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Abroad it was popularised by White Horse Inn, a musical set in the Salzkammergut that reached Broadway in 1936. It also had a fan in screen icon Marlene Dietrich, according to Weissengruber.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/08/12/72f12c74-bd23-4ea1-bfe1-87cdab48db22_5a47fa6c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Along with other traditional Austrian clothing, the dirndl has experienced a revival in recent years, especially at beer festivals. Women today “wear the dirndl at any occasion”, said Schauer, with men donning the famous “lederhosen” leather breeches.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite often cheaper dirndl being produced in Asia, Schauer’s husband, Johannes Topizopoulos, says that many dirndl fans prefer to buy local, especially in an age where people want long-lasting, environmentally sustainable clothing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The fact that it’s hard-wearing fits in with the times very well,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/08/12/3d4c4d16-64c1-4163-8401-024a9f1b4d1a_ec56b0fa.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">High-end versions are certainly a pricey investment: a made-to-measure dirndl can cost between €650 and €1,000 (US$767 and US$1,180), not to mention the versions turned out by fashion houses like Westwood’s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then again, as the exhibition proudly cites the designer as having said during one visit to Austria, “if every woman wore a dirndl, there would be no more ugliness in the world”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmprbW9obnypwcybo55llJ6%2Fr7DLZqCtq12XvKW1wp5ksKCZqbJursuorKydXZa9s7vNZpinnF2bwq24jKyioqqk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-262e1145-91bb-5c5d-b6c4-4357766d9d33-html.html><span>←</span><span>JCJCs Concert Choir begins new season | JC News</span></a>

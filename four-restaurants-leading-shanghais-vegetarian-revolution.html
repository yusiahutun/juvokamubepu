To make up for it, we were offered free desserts – mung bean cakes – to take away.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For those on a green diet, getting your fill can be a nightmare at regular hotpot places, which are all about the meat and seafood, with vegetables included just to fill you up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/d51d16cc-ee64-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_972x_141559.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yan Gege Sushi Hotpot is one of a handful of steamboat restaurants where vegetables are the star of the meal. The best deal is the all-you-can-eat lunch, which is 198 yuan per person, a range of mock meats in spicy sauce as starters and a huge selection of different leafy greens and tofu products.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What most customers come for, however, are the mushroom dishes, such as matsutake soup dumplings and fried rice with black truffle, which each table is allowed to order only once.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Also included is a carefully measured portion of matsutake, porcini mushroom and long net stinkhorn – a mushroom which, despite its name, did not smell or taste foul – which are delivered daily from Yunnan province in southwest China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The split pot came with matsutake soup and a choice of soup. The mushrooms were added to the matsutake soup, to ensure customers can taste their rich flavours, and carefully timed with an hourglass to prevent them from being overcooked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/d9ca6a3a-ee64-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_1320x770_141559.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fine-dining restaurant Dashu Wujie took the spotlight in 2017, gaining a Michelin star; only one other vegetarian restaurant in Shanghai, Fu He Hui, has received the same honour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dashu Wujie has three branches in the city; the one with the Michelin star is on the Bund.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of the several set menus (à la carte is also available) we picked the eight-course “Clouds, Autumn” fixed price menu, which is 599 yuan per person.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/d7e1c4a2-ee64-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_1320x770_141559.JPG><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/d70e9bfe-ee64-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_1320x770_141559.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We loved the black truffle soup, which came with spicy fried pieces of potato skins – most of the flesh removed so it’s not too starchy. The staple dish, Yunnan mushroom fried rice, was cooked to perfection, with crispy rice giving an extra texture. But some dishes were disappointing, both in terms of taste and plating, such as the Sichuan style slow-cooked egg white with tofu, which did not look appealing and tasted bland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The overall dining experience was spoiled by the poor pacing. At one point four dishes were served at the same time, and often while we ate our next dish was waiting at a table nearby.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The service also left a lot to be desired, which was puzzling, given the few customers in the place on the night we visited.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/d566b458-ee64-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_1320x770_141559.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fu He Hui, one of four restaurants in Shanghainese chef Tony Lu’s Fu Group, takes vegetarian food to the next level. In addition to having one star in the Michelin Guide, it ranked #29 in the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list for 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It consistently takes the crown in the vegetarian category of Meituan’s Black Pearl Restaurant Guide.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Porsche and Maserati parked outside the restaurant are good indicators of its price point. The nine-course menu, which costs 880 yuan per person, lists only the main ingredients of each dish, but not how they are cooked, so each is a delightful surprise when served. Instead of trying to make the ingredients taste like meat, the chef brings out the best flavours of the vegetables, and occasionally gives them a twist.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The termite mushroom was smoked and served with chilli powder for an extra kick. Lotus root was served as a deep-fried ball alongside a purée mixed with lily bulbs. Our favourite was the mashed potatoes with onions and truffle, which was rich, flavourful and melting, reminding us of French onion soup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/16/d66eeeb0-ee64-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_1320x770_141559.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are tea pairings for an additional 280 yuan per person. Four types of teas, all prepared in different ways, were served in various containers – all evidence of the chef’s attention to detail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It started with a cold brew yellow tea, served in a champagne glass with honey yuzu powder on its rim. Next was ginger tea with red date, an edible lotus flower adding a hint of sweetness, then a fruity oolong tea. At the end of the meal was an ice drip green tea, that took 24 hours to brew and boosted digestion, relieving our full stomachs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is such an enjoyable dinner that even a die-hard carnivore won’t miss their meat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The Lakeside Veggie</strong>, 2/F Shiguang Li Mall, 230 Ruipin Rd, Xuhui District, tel: +86 021 3356 7008</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Yan Gege Sushi Hotpot</strong>, 800 Changde Rd, Jingan District, tel: +86 021 6222 7217</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Dashu Wujie</strong>, 4/F, 22 Zhongshan East Road, Huangpu District, tel: +86 21 6375 2861</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Fu He Hui</strong>, 1037 Yuyuan Road, Changning District, tel: +86 21 3980 9188</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Where vegetables take pride of plate</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmm6uhnqB8or7TopqlnV9ofXR%2FkG1waJ6fqr9uvsSsq5qtopa7tb%2BMpZyanJmjtG6%2Fx5qloKCRnsBuwsSgnK2Zop6ur3nRnq2opKWptrC6</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./this-morning-cat-deeley-ultra-rare-photo-sons-identical.html><span>←</span><span>Cat Deeley shares ultra-rare photo of young sons and their hair is identical</span></a>

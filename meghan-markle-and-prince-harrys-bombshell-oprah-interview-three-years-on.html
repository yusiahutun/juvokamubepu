Some members of The Firm have done exclusive interviews before – Prince Andrew and Newsnight – but no other royals had been a part of a bombshell chat where the institution itself was a target.</strong></p><p>Three years on, a lot of things have happened since that March episode aired. For the interview, <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> sat opposite <a href=#>celebrity</a> pal Oprah before Harry joined them, with a gorgeous Los Angeles landscape stretching as far as the wide can see behind them. It wasn’t filmed at the Sussexes’ <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a> – we know that. But it was recorded a year after the <a href=#>royals</a> made the big move over the Atlantic. At first, they settled for a brief time in Canada with little Archie, before finding their forever home amid the sprawling and luxury real estate in LA. On the anniversary of the tell-all chat, we take a look at what’s happened within the royal family since.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-and-harry-s-interview-with-oprah-recap>Meghan Markle and Harry’s interview with Oprah – recap</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-s-perspective>Meghan’s perspective</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-04-at-16.33.31-1024x519.png><p>So, what did they actually say? Sit down, make a coffee and relax. We’ve got you covered.</p><p>Meghan Markle joined Oprah first for the interview, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> joined half way through.</p><p>The biggest allegation which surfaced was the Duchess saying palace conversations had revolved around how ‘dark’ Archie’s skin was going to be before he was born. She added there were further discussions on if the little tot would have a royal title and security for the son of Harry. The <a href=#>TV</a> star said concerns on his ‘skin’ color were relayed to her through her husband, but wasn’t there for the actual conversation. Whereas the prince refused to share who made the comments.</p><p>Oprah later came out to say the Duke revealed the royal who made the comments were not the late <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> or Prince Philip.</p><p>The Suits actress also told Oprah she struggled with thoughts of suicide while pregnant alleging palace staff ignored pleas for help. She said she went to a “senior” person for mental <a href=#>health</a> help and was told it wouldn’t “be good for the institution”.</p><p>The now mom-of-two also responded to rumors she made <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> cry over bridesmaid dresses at her wedding. She claimed to Oprah it was actually the Princess of Wales who made her cry, and said she “owned it and apologized”.</p><p>She then told the host she felt there was a “narrative of a hero and a villain” between the sisters-in-law.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-s-perspective>Prince Harry’s perspective</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-04-at-16.37.08-1024x513.png><p>When Harry joined Meghan and Oprah in the interview he told her he “felt trapped” by being a member of the royal family. He also alleged “the rest of my family” are also trapped, including his brother <a href=#>Prince William</a> and dad – who is now monarch.</p><p>The Duke said he felt “let down” by his father, <a href=#>King Charles</a>, and wanted The Firm to bite back against negativity and rumors online.</p><p>He claimed “no one in my family said anything in those two years”, and said the palace was reliant on the press.</p><p>When discussing his brother, Harry told Oprah he and <a href=#>William were now ‘distant’</a> in the interview, as he held hands with wife Meghan. Then he claimed the late Queen Elizabeth II had been given “bad advice” from the people around her. This was alongside him revealing the pair took multi-million deals with <a href=#>Netflix</a> and for a podcast. He said they took the deals because the couple were ‘cut off financially’ when they backed out of The firm.</p><p>Harry then told Oprah the pair had a ‘secret’ marriage ceremony with the Archbishop of Canterbury in their ‘backyard’ three days <a href=#>before their royal wedding</a>. He said the ‘spectacle’ was for the world, instead. Some royal fans were upset over this. After the Archbishop came out to explain it wasn’t a legal ceremony as they only said their vows, they described it differently.</p><p>The pair announced their next child was going to be a girl, after revealing Meg was pregnant on Valentine’s Day. The little bundle of joy ended up becoming Lilibet -who was <a href=#>named after the Queen’s adorable nickname</a> as a child.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-palace-s-perspective>The palace’s perspective</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1387844723-1024x740.jpg><p>Individual members of the royal family haven’t really said much since Meghan and Harry’s Oprah interview. But one did – William, the next heir to the throne.</p><p>Buckingham Palace released a rare statement following the televised chat.</p><p>They said: “The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan.”</p><p>“The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning.</p><p>“Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.”</p><p>Prince William was also filmed going to an official event the following day it aired. He told reporters the royals were very much “not a racist family”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-has-anything-changed-since-meghan-and-harry-s-oprah-interview>Has anything changed since Meghan and Harry’s Oprah Interview?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-04-at-16.35.22-1024x524.png><p>If we take a look at all the allegations, the biggest bombshell is another claim that came almost three years later.</p><p>Writer <a href=#>Omid Scobie, who penned Endgame</a>, published a book in November last year. Reports following the release, claimed a Dutch translation of the book included two names of royals who were alleged to have made comments on Archie’s skin color. The palace has not responded to these claims. The writer himself said he didn’t write one draft that had the names in them. However, the translator came out to say she was given a previous draft for her work. She claimed they were printed in there. As a result, all copies affected were <a href=#>pulled from the shelves for a reprint</a>.</p><p><strong>Celebrity Tidbit previously approached the palace for comment, and received no answer.</strong></p><p>In terms of mental health, William spoke on a panel on World Mental Health Day last October to discuss the topic. Alongside Catherine, he spoke about the tools for positive mindset, and asked to hear from young people to shape their Royal Foundation work in mental health.</p><p>Prince Harry also opened up again over his mental health. He paired up with Oprah again for the Apple TV series, The Me You Can’t See. He spoke in depth over fears for Meghan and what happened to <a href=#>Princess Diana</a> would happen to his own wife.</p><p>In his book Spare, the Duke published the alleged <a href=#>text messages between Kate and Meghan</a> that made the Duchess cry. This was to back up his wife from what she told cameras over the bridesmaid dresses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-appears-to-mend-some-bridges>Harry appears to mend some bridges</h3><p>The now 39-year-old said he was “distant” with his brother, but the pair met up to unveil a statue of their mom Diana in Kensington gardens. Months after the Oprah interview, Harry left Meghan back in the US and flew over to Britain. The brothers were side by side as they revealed the project they commissioned together in her memory.</p><p>He previously claimed he hadn’t spoken to his father much, but in recent years that seems to be improving. On Charles’ 75th birthday last year, a source close to the couple said they had FaceTimed the King to celebrate, where he saw <a href=#>Archie and Lilibet</a> as well.</p><p>Then, after <a href=#>Charles was diagnosed with cancer</a> earlier this year, Harry flew across the ocean to see him. Although he only managed to spend 25 hours in the UK, he told <a href=#>GMA tough times</a> like these ‘unite families’.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> ventured to his native land in September 2022 for the WellChild Awards. But as they did the late Queen’s health took a turn. They cancelled their appearance to mourn the monarch and stayed in the country for the funeral service.</p><p>Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet did receive their titles. A royal rule had been put in place before their first child that meant only the grandchild of a monarch would have a title. So this only included the grandchildren of the Queen who was on the throne. When Charles ascended to head of state, the two children became Prince and Princess.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bringing-home-the-bacon>Bringing home the bacon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-01-18-at-09.34.47-1024x565.png><p>As Harry claimed the couple only signed up for the big deals with the streaming giant and <a href=#>Spotify</a> ($20m) after ‘being cut off’, they’re still working with Netflix ($100m). Their docu-series, Harry & Meghan, came out in December 2022, where they spoke about their time in The Firm again.</p><p>Meghan’s podcast, Archetypes, had come out six months earlier but after a dozen or so episodes was axed. The music app and the Duchess of Sussex announced the decision was mutual. <a href=#>Meghan also appeared to back down</a>, as she retracted a copyright claim for the name. Omid Scobie claimed the Sussexes didn’t get the full $20m after parting ways.</p><p>However, last month, it was announced she’s signed a new deal with Lemonada Media. Her older episodes from Spotify will be on there too. Although, it’s not yet known if she’ll continue the same theme or start something fresh.</p><p>Harry then embarked on a project with Netflix for his series Invictus, following coaches and athletes as they prepared for the 2022 games. Their next projects haven’t been unveiled. But Bela Bajaria, Netflix Chief Content Officer says the pair have a <a href=#>movie</a>, TV show and unscripted shows in the making.</p><p>Aside from that, Harry’s four-book deal with Penguin Random House is said to be worth $35-$40m. So far, the dad-of-two has only released one memoir and experts believe he may write another further down the line. His memoir, published via a ghost writer, surpassed Barack Obama’s biography for fastest-selling book of all time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-s-next-for-meghan-and-harry-after-oprah-s-interview>What’s next for Meghan and Harry after Oprah’s interview?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-04-at-16.37.34-1024x525.png><p><a href=#>Meghan herself told reporters at a Red Carpet</a> event last fall they have exciting projects coming up.</p><p>The pair were recently seen visiting Canada ahead of the Invictus Games, and the Duke was getting stuck in with competing with a big smile on his face.</p><p>Although he spoke about his father’s ill health, he believes their bond will get stronger through the difficult time.</p><p>Sources believe <a href=#>Meghan may make a big Hollywood comeback</a>. Especially after seeing her sit down with Oprah’s friend and producer last week.</p><p>Harry still has three books left as part of his deal, but Meghan is also an author herself. She penned a children’s book The Bench, which came from a poem she wrote for Harry on Father’s Day over the relationship he has with Archie. Perhaps she’ll craft something?</p><p>Aside from that, they’re keeping it close to their chest. It’s been a wild three years.</p><p><strong>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.

Milan Christopher agrees with Tank, who recently proclaimed performing oral sex on a man -- twice -- does not make you gay.
The openly gay rapper backed the singer up while out in LA last week, arguing that many people experiment before figuring out their sexuality."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

"If you saw me eating a salad, does that mean that all of a sudden, I'm vegan?"</p><p>He pointed out that he had more than two intimate encounters with women in his early days.</p><p>"I spent my whole high school having sex with girls and eating p---y," he said. "I ain't seen one person saying, 'Milan Christopher is straight.' So, we can't be as judgmental."</p><p>Tank's comments came during a recent interview with Angela Yee on her Lip Service podcast, when the host posed the hypothetical question on whether or not it meant a man was gay if he "sucked a d--k twice"; the singer then explained why it did not.</p><p>"He sucked a d--k once, right? Then, he's like I'm not sure if I liked it or not. Let me try it again, and then he says, 'You know what? It's not for me. Don't like the taste'," Tank theorized.</p><p>"See what I'm saying? It doesn't mean he's gay," he insisted. "It means he sucked d--k twice. The art of being gay is being gay. It's a continuous state of being."</p><p>Social media was quick to react, with many claiming the singer -- who identifies as heterosexual -- was hiding his true sexuality.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6896c740-2079-5206-8523-7b66324642a5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:1694074d-f8f3-5cf1-a2af-9a3ec7d9570a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/60/5by4/2019/10/21/60f75232204d59a0b16bf8bcf9b187a3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Miley Cyrus Slammed for Saying 'You Don't Have to Be Gay', As She Appears to Shade Liam Hemsworth</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>But according to Milan, everybody needs to experiment to find what they are attracted to.</p><p>"It takes experimentation. We're human," he said. "If you want to get technical, I don't think a sexual act with a person is what makes you gay or straight. I think having love for that person is what makes you gay or straight."</p><p>He also pointed to what he perceived to be a double standard regarding women and experimentation.</p><p>"They can tongue kiss, have sex with girls, and the next thing you know they're married and they're popping out babies. And it's okay!" he said. "You know, it was an experiment, it was a phase. "</p><p>"If a guy does it one time, it's a wrap. They're gay."</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?

Osmium is the heaviest metal found on earth. Osmium's weight is twice that of lead metal. This toxic and extremely volatile element is also the most dense metal in the periodic table, with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">22.59 g / cm³ density</a>.</p><p class=align-left>It is a rare element that is extracted from platinum. And if you thought gold is valuable, then this hard, brittle metal with a bluish-white appearance is 30 times more valuable than gold because it is 1500 times rarer and has ten times more purity than gold.

Pretty influencer Ceolin is 25 years his junior. Not one to judge, SunSport explores the relationships of other former players. From Neil "Razor" Ruddock to the debonair Thierry Henry, these chaps clearly feel young at heart.

Carol is 22-years younger than Rushy, 60, but she's previously admitted she doesn't see the age gap as an issue. They began dating in 2013.</p><h2>PETER SCHMEICHEL AND LAURA VON LINDHOLM</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000467011421.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000467011353.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000467011383.jpg><p>Former keeper Schmeichel married former Playboy model Laura von Lindholm recently. The pair had split up two-years ago after beginning their relationship in 2014 -&nbsp;<a href=#>but recently re-coupled and decided to tie the knot.</a> The legendary <a href=#>Manchester United</a> goalie proposed to his longterm partner in the Maldives during a fireworks display at the luxurious One&Only Reethi Rah resort in February. Schmeichel is 58, while Laura is 48. The marriage took place in front of 200 guests at the Egebaeksvang Church in Espergaerde, Copenhagen - four months after they got engaged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000497888425.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000497886405.jpg><h2>BRENDAN RODGERS AND CHARLOTTE SEARLE</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000325981797.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000325555530.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000237850864.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000290836335.jpg><p><a href=#>The Leicester City manager, 49,</a> tied the knot with Searle - 11 years his junior - on the banks of Loch Lomond in a glitzy ceremony back in 2017. He was previously married to wife Susan for 14 years, but they divorced in 2015. Tragedy struck Searle a year after she wed former Liverpool and Celtic boss Rodgers when her ex husband Steven Hind took his own life.</p><h2>DAVID GINOLA AND MAEVA DENAT</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000472744188.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000386959064.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000386959602.jpg><p>The suave Frenchman, now a talkSPORT host, was always a football pin-up. So it's no wonder the handsome 55-year-old ex-Spurs star is dating a 32-year-old. Denat is a model, and she welcomed <a href=#>the pair's first chid</a> last year.</p><h2>THIERRY HENRY AND ANDREA RAJACIC</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000422765502.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000177305738.jpg><p>He's definitely still va-va-voom! The former Arsenal ace, 44, has a stunning longterm girlfriend in Rajacic, a 34-year-old Bosnian model. They met in 2008 and welcomed a son, Tristan in 2012.</p><h2>NEIL RUDDOCK AND LEAH NEWMAN</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473822042.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473823543.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473823535.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473823495.jpg><p>The burly Tottenham defender didn't just have the fame of football to charm the ladies with, so he became a reality TV favourite on shows such as I'm a Celebrity... Busty glamour model Leah Newman, 40, married 'Razor' Ruddock, 53, in 2013 after they dated for nine years. She once appeared on TV show Can’t Pay We’ll Take it Away, on which she threw water over some bailiffs who visited her Kent home.</p><h2>PETER AND STEPHANIE SHILTON</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000288079764.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000436609185.jpg><p>The legendary England and Leicester City keeper, 72, wed former jazz singer Steph Hayward in 2016 when she was 48. But the 21-year age gap hasn't affected these two lovebirds, who are often joined at the hip. They even set up up their <a href=#>own consultancy business</a> together, which shows love knows no bounds.</p><h2>DAVID SEAMAN AND FRANKIE POULTNEY</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000059723912.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000472453844-e1551793926144.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000362095578-e1551794042839.jpg><p>Even though they clearly get on like a house on fire, it's fair to say David, 58, and Frankie, 48, initially got off to an icy start. That's because they met on reality TV show Dancing On Ice all the way back in 2008. They reportedly fell in love on the show's live tour, and tied the knot in 2015 at Dormy House in the Cotswolds. She's certainly in safe hands with Arsenal and England's former No1.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Mauro Icardi’s model wife Wanda looks amazing as she takes part in some seriously sexy shoots</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX22Cd4GPcWxonp%2BkwaOty6Wcq2WimsGqvsSdZLKnpaO0bsPAoGSrp52Wv6q7jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-pickens-jr-on-career-highlights-and-secret-to-his-marriage.html><span>←</span><span>James Pickens Jr. on Career Highlights and Secret to His Marriage</span></a>

Looking back, Katrina admitted: 'She was a young mother who didn't have her priorities straight - men was a number one priority and going out partying.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Katrina's grandmother had been introduced to Scientology when she visited Florida for work. The older woman was immediately hooked, signing up as a member of the Sea Org - the church's quasi-military administrative body - after barely two weeks in the country.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to Katrina her grandmother thought life at Scientology's Flag headquarters in Clearwater might help her own daughter straighten her life out.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She recalled: 'My grandmother painted a picture of a good life, a purpose, a job, helping people, you never have to worry about a roof over your head or me having an education.

I remember to this day. I read 'a billion years' and I thought that was maybe just a way of saying, 'I completely and utterly dedicate my life.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'At the same time I remember thinking: this is what my mother is doing so I have no choice. Wherever she goes I just have to follow her.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And there was little about her life in Eastern Europe that Katrina thought she would miss. Katrina, real name Yekaterina Tihonova, spent most of her childhood in Barnaul, Siberia. It was, she said, 'like a third world country.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We lived in a wooden house, no heating, no plumbing, no electricity. I'd have to haul the water from buckets, it was a pretty miserable existence.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her grandmother 'coached' her to tell officials that she had every intention of returning to Russia so that she and her mother would be granted visas.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: 'I remember arriving at Tampa airports and everything was nice and clean and different. I remember the big automatic glass doors. That was the first time I'd ever seen them. I was like, "Wow! Everything is so civilized here."'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The excitement was short lived. She and her mother were taken to live in Sea Org housing - The Hacienda Gardens, rows of dilapidated and overcrowded buildings.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They shared a one-bedroom apartment with a dozen other women (men and women are housed separately).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: 'The living room had three bunk beds in it, then there was one dining room and three more bunk beds in the bedroom. The apartment was so old. It was filthy, disgusting, there were cockroaches - absolutely huge things - mildew was everywhere because of the humidity, tiles coming off the wall.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She shared a bunk with her mother as the two were recruited into the so-called Estates Project Force (EPF) - a Sea Org boot camp of sorts designed as a crash course to being qualified to be given a post, or job.</p><img id=i-8db89c78669c9b0a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/09/16/48ED8DF800000578-0-image-a-31_1518193231315.jpg height=248 width=634 alt="She and her mother were taken to live in Sea Org housing - The Hacienda Gardens, rows of dilapidated and overcrowded buildings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>She and her mother were taken to live in Sea Org housing - The Hacienda Gardens, rows of dilapidated and overcrowded buildings</p><img id=i-a2dc893c46a88f17 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/09/16/48ED8DF400000578-0-image-a-28_1518192965469.jpg height=310 width=634 alt="The Hacienda Gardens, where Katrina lived and worked, and is heavily fortified with a motion sensored fence, security and a manned gate" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Hacienda Gardens, where Katrina lived and worked, and is heavily fortified with a motion sensored fence, security and a manned gate</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Katrina said: 'The only thing I was excited about was that my mother was going to be away from her old life, things she used to do [I thought] she's finally going to concentrate on me instead of men, partying and abandoning me.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I thought it was an opportunity for us to have a clean start.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was not to be. Days consisted of early starts, often heavy manual labor and hours of study. Katrina questioned everything, unable to go along with the theories espoused.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile her mother absorbed it all and passed out of the EPF in three months. She was given a job and Katrina was informed that her mother would be moving into different housing while she stayed on behind.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: 'That was very upsetting for me when I found out she can't live with me. We joined September 26, 1999. By New Years she was already done. I never lived with her again.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After a year Katrina was assigned the post of Tech Page which meant she organized the roster of Scientologists who came to Clearwater to be audited. Sessions could cost up to $1,000 an hour during which members were grilled and their answers read on L Ron Hubbard's E-meter - a primitive polygraph test.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was a huge money making enterprise, Katrina recalled. The priority was to get as many members in and through the process as possible, then sign them up for more courses, more auditing, more spending.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Katrina said: 'The first briefing of the day, the leader David Miscavige's questions were always, "Who blew? (who ran away?) Lawsuits, Media and then how much money Flag made."&nbsp;</p><img id=i-f32f7c9b15995b85 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/09/16/4901C97C00000578-0-image-a-24_1518192880691.jpg height=750 width=634 alt="Katrina was declared a 'suppressive' person by the church in 2015" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Katrina was declared a 'suppressive' person by the church in 2015</p><img id=i-e41dca45e4ea248f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/09/16/48FA0FB400000578-0-image-a-32_1518193640280.jpg height=527 width=634 alt="The two worked long hours as Sea Org members and Katrina was only allowed to see her mother for 40 minutes a day&nbsp;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The two worked long hours as Sea Org members and Katrina was only allowed to see her mother for 40 minutes a day&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Katrina enjoyed the contact with a world outside the Sea Org's rigid constraints but it made her yearn for freedom of her own. She admitted: 'I'd see these people with their nice cars, nice house, cell phones, dressed nicely, good children…it made me envious. I just wanted freedom, to get in a car and go anywhere I want.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We were herded in buses every day. At The Hacienda we had a perimeter fence, and when I once touched it, three security guards on bikes immediately surrounded me asking, "Who the f*** touched the fence?" Then I realized it was motion activated.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Days were long - starting at 6am and sometimes not finishing until two, three, four in the morning. Failure to hit quotas for sales led to physical and mental punishment - sleep deprivation, being forced to eat rice and beans for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The only glimmer of light in her day came at 7pm when Katrina ate her dinner and had a chance to spend 40 minutes with her mother.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Celebrities would often spend time in town, staying at one of the church-owned hotels such as the Osceola Inn or the Sandcastle, where Katrina's mother worked.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Katrina recalled: 'You weren't allowed to go near Tom Cruise. You weren't allowed to speak or look at him. But we knew he was coming to Flag, as we'd have to white glove everything. It was a huge operation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We had to clean all the waiting areas, auditing rooms, then it would be inspected by someone who puts on a white cotton glove and touches every surface.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cruise would stay in the penthouse at the Osceola Inn, she said. He moved everywhere with a 'huge entourage' and his presence was always heralded by the arrival of two large black Cadillac SUVs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>John Travolta was a bit more relaxed. She said, 'He was lovely. I would pass by him in the hallways and restaurants and he would look you in the eye and say, 'Hello, how are you?'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kirstie Allie used to stay at the Sandcastle and Katrina recalled her mother telling her that they had to refurbish all her rooms and provide her with 'orange Egyptian Cotton sheets.'</p><img id=i-2bcbf7a922115e1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/09/16/48ED8E3200000578-0-image-a-33_1518193647994.jpg height=556 width=634 alt="She stayed in touch with her mother long enough for the older woman to come to her wedding in 2013" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>She stayed in touch with her mother long enough for the older woman to come to her wedding in 2013</p><img id=i-e8f8bd07066beab4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/09/16/48ED8E2200000578-0-image-a-40_1518193701243.jpg height=614 width=306 alt="In 2016 when she was five months pregnant with her son, she went to Clearwater to try to visit her mother, but her attempt was ignored (pictured with her husband Jose)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-5c80a302f1413e21 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/09/16/48ED8E2600000578-0-image-m-39_1518193693166.jpg height=614 width=306 alt="Katrina gave birth to son Nolan in August 2016" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Katrina now lives with her husband Jose in Austin, Texas.

Katrina said: 'I remember it was Friday when we picked up our pay and you would get your little envelope with cash in it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Somebody from the office that looks after VIPs was at the door going, "We need a donation for Tom Cruise's birthday. It's mandatory - $35."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'So out of the $50 you got paid, minus tax, two or three weeks in a row they were taking $35 as a donation to pitch in for Tom Cruise's birthday present which we found out was like a really expensive dirt bike.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was a miserable existence that Katrina knew deep down was not for her, but she couldn't see a way out. In the end her departure from the Sea Org came in the most devastating circumstances.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2006 Katrina managed to persuade Sea Org officials to allow her to travel to Russia to get her citizenship passport - a legal requirement. On the final night of her trip, staying with relatives in Siberia, she argued with a family member so violently that she felt she couldn't stay there that night.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She called some old neighborhood friends and they went to a bar to drink and 'chill.'&nbsp;</p><img id=i-ed5f0307b267e5a3 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/09/16/490A3DA000000578-0-image-m-52_1518193931887.jpg height=870 width=634 alt="Katrina says none of the members were allowed to 'go near or look at' Tom Cruise.

I remember walking up some steps in a weird apartment building, I remember little bits and pieces.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The next think I remember waking up in bed with two guys next to me and realizing I'd been raped and I was still a virgin - in Scientology you're not allowed to have any sexual relations until you're legally married.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Now I look back on this and realize how bad this Scientology brainwashes you to the point where my first thought wasn't, "Oh my God I need to call the police, I need to go to the hospital."&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My first thought was, "I'm going to get into trouble with the church because I've broken one of the core rules."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Katrina was due to return to Florida that night so she gathered her clothing from the floor, washed herself off in the bathroom and left, flying back to the States as planned.

She was eight years old.</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title><a href=#>CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY STATEMENT ON KATRINA REYES</a></h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>We have checked our records and can confirm that Ms. Reyes was dismissed from the Sea Organization in October of 2006 after a long, unchanged pattern of misconduct, which she was given many chances to correct. That conduct most emphatically did not include being the victim of a sexual assault. If any Sea Organization member were to report being the victim of a crime, they would receive prompt medical attention and assistance in reporting the matter to law enforcement.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Ms. Reyes was an adult when she went on a vacation in the fall of 2006. When she returned in October 2006, she reported that she had gone partying with some friends, got drunk and woke up in bed with one of them. She asked one of her friends what had happened and he said she had gotten drunk and smoked marijuana. He did not confirm any sexual contact. Her contemporaneous handwritten account states that she was not even certain she had had sex. She certainly did not report that she was the victim of a sexual assault. Nevertheless, she was offered a medical examination, but refused to see a doctor. Thus, the Church never had confirmation that anything sexual ever occurred, voluntary or otherwise. The drinking and drug use were among a string of incidents that included thefts and lying, all of which made it clear that she was not suited to life in the Sea Organization and she was let go.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Katrina Reyes is part of the same clique of anti-Scientologists being shopped to the media by Tony Ortega that the Mail regularly features. Her story appeared on his website in January. Her tale has grown with the re-telling and now more than a&nbsp;decade later it has achieved its present form. Ms. Reyes's other descriptions of life in the Sea Organization are equally false.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Reyes has never met Mr. Miscavige and there was never any 'first briefing of the day' by Mr. Miscavige. You attribute and 'quote' him with words he never said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If you do decide to run this story, I request that you include the Church’s response about Ms. Reyes in full.&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: 'So I'm going through this with this man and the next question that came out of his mouth was, "Did you enjoy it? Did you misbehave on purpose so he would hit you this way?"&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And I just lost it. I said, "F*** you. I'm done. I'm not going to answer any more questions because this is actual torture right now."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>An hour or two later she was informed she was being kicked out of the Sea Org and sent back to Russia.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By then Katrina had a green card but she was still so browbeaten by Scientology she didn't think to fight it as she was taken to the airport and watched as she got on the plane.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A security guard accompanied her as well as her mother, whom she had asked for, to make sure Katrina got on the plane and, she believes, her mother didn't.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said, 'I was really mad at my mother then. Once again you're abandoning me.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With no experience of life outside the Sea Org, few resources and little education, Katrina scratched by over the next couple of years working where she could until she had saved enough to return to America.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Russia, after all, was a foreign country to her. In 2008 she came back. She was still a Scientologist, and not 'in good standings' due to her departure from the Sea Org.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As hard as it is to understand she wanted to regain her place in the church because it was all that she knew and it was her link to her mother.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But just a couple of days after her return to Clearwater, Florida two Sea Org members bumped into her in a bank.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The next thing she knew a church security guard angrily approached her and said, 'You interbulated (a Scientology term meaning to bring up bad feelings) those Sea Org members. Get the f*** out of Clearwater or I'm going to declare your a**.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To be 'declared' a suppressive person was the thing Katrina feared most because it meant disconnecting from her mother and grandmother.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Scientologists are not allowed to communicate with 'suppressive' people and though the church denies the policy of disconnecting exists, Katrina's own experience says otherwise.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Katrina headed to Orlando. She worked and she began dating the man who would become her husband. She stayed in touch with her mother long enough for the older woman to come to her wedding in 2013 but the relationship was strained almost to breaking point even then.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She claims the church harassed and called her constantly trying to get her to sign up for 'services' to get her back in good standings'. But distance and her husband's influence started to loosen the ties that once bound her.</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/07/18/482E275700000578-0-image-m-26_1518026805304.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>EXCLUSIVE: Texas nuns help illegal migrants at a shelter as...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2018/02/09/03/4903C7DA00000578-0-image-a-37_1518145876151.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Texas doctor's mother and father-in-law are arrested for...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Eventually, when her own mother called telling her to stop communicating with known 'suppressive' people on social media something in Katrina snapped.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said, 'Not even my husband has the right to tell me who I can and can't befriends with.

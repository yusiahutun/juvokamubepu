In 2023, the actress, 31, detailed the brutal 12-hour schedule as a pre-teen, including the 5:30am call time. <a href=#>Cyrus’ younger sister</a>, Noah, followed in her footsteps and appeared in several Hannah Montana <a href=#>TV</a> episodes. But as an actress and singer in her own right, the 24-year-old admitted the struggles of living up to her sibling.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-937376418-1024x696.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-noah-cyrus-details-unbearable-experience-as-miley-s-sister>Noah Cyrus details ‘unbearable’ experience as Miley’s sister</h2><p>In a 2020 <a href=#>Instagram</a> Live, Noah, 24, revealed the truth of having a world-famous sister in the same industry.</p><p>“Being born in the family I was in, everybody gave me such a hard time for having a hard time being Miley’s little sister, but I always felt like I was that person that no one gave a s*** about due to what people said to me online,” she tearfully explained while discussing her EP, The End Of Everything.</p><p>“And that’s why I write. ‘My sister’s like sunshine / Always bringing good light wherever she’ll go / And I was born to rain clouds / Blessed in her shadows,” she said referring to the song Young And Sad.</p><p>Online comments are harsh enough, but constant comparison to a more successful sibling impacted her self-esteem massively.</p><p>“I feel like sometimes I feel like I don’t even breathe right sometimes,” she told fans.</p><p>Brushing the haters aside, Noah Cyrus has continued to build her career away from Hannah Montana, starting with a voice role in 2008 Japanese animated film Ponyo. Her latest role was a 2021 episode of American Horror Stories. As for her music, Cyrus has worked with the likes of XXXTentacion, and Alan Walker, and opened for Katy Perry’s Witness: The Tour at 17. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> earned a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-694644770-764x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-noah-cyrus-calls-out-sister-miley-s-disrespect>Noah Cyrus ‘calls out’ sister Miley’s ‘disrespect’</h2><p>The Cyrus sisters are notable for their close relationship, even performing together on several occasions. However, screenshots circulating in October 2023 allegedly show Noah criticizing Miley’s review of The End Of Everything on Joe Rogan’s podcast.</p><p>The Party In The USA singer is heard calling the record “the most depressing EP you’ll ever listen to.”</p><p>“She’s got a record out that I love called&nbsp;The End of Everything. She’s 20 years old, she’s emo. She’s, like, an emo kid,” the <a href=#>music</a> star continued.</p><p>“You know, it’s like, she’s really got this idea of me,” Miley said about Young And Sad’s lyrics.</p><p>Screenshots show Noah <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">commenting</a> under a <a href=#>TikTok</a> of the clip: “The disrespect in this video.”</p><p>It fueled speculation of a family feud. But others suggest it was a response to Rogan’s suggesting Noah to “go the doctor.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z9cLDAq6Jmq5mZsm67xWakoqSVrnqkxdGuqmaekaKybsDHmqtmmZabsqTAxJ1koZ2iYsawwc2gnKtlo57AtbHRZp2oqpWrsrN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-214a2c34-cf56-11ee-868d-e7ee041f7f22-html.html><span>←</span><span>Benny Thomas Stringer | Obituaries</span></a>

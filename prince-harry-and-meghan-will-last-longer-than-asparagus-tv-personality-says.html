Amid the predictions that Meghan and Harry may split up this year, a leading commentator has said that the Sussexes will “last longer than asparagus.”</strong></p><p>A lot has been said and written about <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Prince Harry’s rough ride in 2023. The couple started the year with the release of Harry’s bombshell memoir Spare. However, the going got tough from there. Not only did they face major career setbacks like the axing of their $20 million <a href=#>Spotify</a> deal. The tabloids were also rife with rumors about their supposed marital troubles. Now a British commentator has weighed in on the prediction that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex may split in 2024.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-995715966-766x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-and-meghan-will-last-longer-than-asparagus>Harry and Meghan will ‘last longer than asparagus’</h2><p>British commentator and TV presenter Rafe Heydel-Mankoo recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke</a> to GB News about how the royals fared in 2023. The host asked Rafe about his thoughts on Mystic Veg’s prediction for Meghan and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> in 2024. The mystic used asparagus to predict that there was a “split looming” for the Sussexes in this year.</p><p>Rafe slammed the royal experts who often comment on the state of Meghan and Harry’s marriage. “None of us are privy to that information,” he said.</p><p>“I think they will last longer than any asparagus.”</p><p>However, Rafe did share his thoughts about the Sussexes’ disastrous year and Harry’s role in it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-476470076-1024x647.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-is-the-primary-reason-for-the-sussexes-disastrous-year>Harry is the ‘primary reason’ for the Sussexes ‘disastrous’ year</h2><p>After <a href=#>King Charles</a> was named the “royal hero” of 2023, the TV anchor asked Rafe who the “royal zero” of 2023 was. The host drew a comparison between Meghan and Harry’s 2023 with the queen’s “Annus Horribilis”.</p><p>The late <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> called 1992 her “annus horribilis” (horrible year). The year was marked by a series of disasters for the <a href=#>royals</a>. The marriage of three out of four of the queen’s kids ended that year. There was also a fire in the late queen’s home Windsor Castle.</p><p>Speaking to GB News, Rafe called 2023 an “annus harrybilis” for the Sussexes. The TV presenter also said it was primarily Harry who made 2023 a disastrous year for his family. The royal expert talked about how the 39-year-old Duke’s book Spare became a laughing stock globally.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-will-miss-the-uk-in-2024-psychic-says><strong>Harry will </strong>‘<strong>miss the UK’ in 2024, psychic says</strong></h2><p>Celebrity Psychic medium <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Adam Norton</a>‘s predictions for Harry in 2024 say the Duke <a href=#>will ‘begin to miss’ the UK</a> this year.</p><p>The psychic believes that Harry is “putting on a front at the moment.”</p><p>“I don’t feel a lot of happiness around him yet,” Norton claimed. “Not deep happiness anyway. I do feel he’ll miss the UK, and the fact he’s pretty much out of the royal family I feel deep down he’ll begin to regret this.</p><p>“I actually see the royal family throwing another dig at him over the middle of 2024,” Norton told Celebrity Tidbit.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z%2BcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaYp5xdorKotMCnZLChnKF6ra3SrWSlp56csrN506GYp2WRqL2ivsCgrKxlpKt6sbHRrKanmZyewbp50pqwrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nudist-resort-naked-travel-luxury-16953780.html><span>←</span><span>Naked holidays on the rise would you strip off at one of these nudist resorts?</span></a>

Pitt sued, claiming they had agreed to get the other’s consent before selling any joint assets. Jolie counter-sued, claiming such an agreement never existed and that in selling her share of the winery, she’d be granted “financial independence” from Pitt and the opportunity to “have some form of peace and closure to this deeply painful and traumatic chapter of her and their children’s lives.”</p><p>In a new lawsuit filed in April 2024, Jolie claimed that Pitt’s “history of physical abuse of Jolie started well before the family’s September 2016 plane trip from France to Los Angeles,” but does not go into further detail. “At trial, Jolie will prove through testimony, emails, photographs, and other evidence why Pitt was so concerned about his own misconduct that he blew up his own deal to purchase Jolie’s interest in Miraval because she refused to agree to his new, expansive NDA,” the filing reads.</p><p>The ongoing legal proceedings and “Pitt’s unyielding attempts to control and punish Jolie continue to take a huge emotional and financial toll on her and their family,” the filing reads. “Jolie longs for their family to be able to heal and their children to be spared further pain and trauma, and truly wishes Pitt would want the same too.” So does Brad Pitt see his kids? Read on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=does-brad-pitt-see-his-kids>Does Brad Pitt see his kids?</h2><p>According to sources, Pitt has been working hard to regain the trust of Maddox, Pax, and Zahara but they’re not in contact with their dad. Pitt is reportedly focused on maintaining the relationship that he’s “rebuilt” with Shlioh, Knox and Vivienne and does spend time with the three of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-jids.jpg><p>“<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Brad cherishes time with&nbsp;his kids</a>&nbsp;and loves seeing them when he can, when he’s in town, once or twice a week,” an insider told OK! Magazine. “It’s definitely something he prioritizes.” The insider added: “Brad absolutely hasn’t given up hope on the others, and hopes one day there will be peace in their hearts.”</p><p>“In about three years, they’ll all be over 18,” a source told&nbsp;In Touch&nbsp;on February 27. “Brad is determined to regain their trust so he can continue to be in their lives as adults.” As for the older kids, Brad is hopeful that “one day there will be peace in their hearts,” according to the source.</p><p>When it comes to introducing his girlfriend Ines to his children, he reportedly wants to make sure the timing is right. “It’s not that he doesn’t love Ines, it’s just that he wants to ensure this relationship is going the distance before he takes that major step,” an insider&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>told US Weekly</a> in October 2023. “She knows it’s a touchy situation,” another source told&nbsp;In Touch. “She clearly wants to let them enjoy their bonding time with Brad one-on-one.”</p><p>With regard to the most recent lawsuit, a source close to Pitt has spoken out about the situation. “This is a pattern of behavior — whenever there is a decision that goes against the other side they consistently choose to introduce misleading, inaccurate and/or irrelevant information as a distraction,” a friend told People. “There was a lengthy&nbsp;custody trial that involved the entire history of their relationship and a judge who heard all the evidence still granted him 50/50 custody.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm1vbnFiZK%2BzrcNmp6KspGLAprGMpKCdq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hgtv-christina-hall-frolics-denim-one-piece-see-who-she-is-with.html><span>←</span><span>Christina Hall frolics in denim one-piece and you won't believe who she is with</span></a>

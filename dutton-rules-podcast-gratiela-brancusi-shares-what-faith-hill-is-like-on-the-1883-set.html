They have quite a bit in common.</p><p>Brancusi spoke to Taste of Country's Sterling Whitaker, and this week he joins host Adison Haager to talk about it.&nbsp;Other highlights of&nbsp;the interview include her opening up about the love scene she filmed for Ep. 6, and how Mother Nature was not on her side. She also shared that she and Hill became very close, and McGraw (James Dutton) was a "hoot."</p><p>"I so love Faith," she shares. "I became close with Faith. This is the one common thread that I blame Taylor (1883 creator Taylor Sheridan), is that he's managed to put this cast together and everyone is so kind. They're just the most kind people I've met. This is Faith's first job, too, and yet she was just always there, sort of making sure that people are taken care of ... it was like her mother spirit."</p><p>Click play to listen, or, if you would rather listen later, find&nbsp;Dutton Rules&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=#>Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Spotify</a>&nbsp;and look for archive interviews with&nbsp;1883 stars including Sam Elliott, McGraw&nbsp;and Hill,&nbsp;plus&nbsp;<a href=#>Yellowstone</a>&nbsp;stars including Cole Hauser and more.

The ranch centers around a 13-bedroom, 13-bathroom, 13,280-square-foot main residence, which is constructed of quarry rock that was hauled to Guthrie by wagon. The ranch also includes vast, sweeping fenced pastures, farmland, fenced-in pens for cattle, a more recent addition for horses, a water filtration plant that serves the ranch's water needs and more.</p><p>There are separate camp manager's homes in both the North Camp and the South Camp of the ranch, which encompasses nearly 225 square miles of land. Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan is part of a group of investors who recently acquired the property for $192 million, and he has been shooting his new show out there in recent months.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>10 'Yellowstone' Facts You Probably Didn't Know</h2>How big of a fan of <a href=#>Yellowstone</a> are you?

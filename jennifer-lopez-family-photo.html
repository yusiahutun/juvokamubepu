That’s how J.Lo and her gorgeous family spent Labor Day 2020—and it’s honestly giving us early 2000s vibes in the best way. <a href=# rel=noopener>Jennifer Lopez’s family photo</a> featured not only the performer, her fiancé Alex Rodriguez and four beautiful children, but a seriously swoon-worthy ensemble as well. (Are we even surprised?) Leave it to J.Lo to turn a classic family portrait into a style moment that has me reaching for my wallet.</p><p>The family posed in front of (and in!) a tree for the photo, and the simplicity of the location definitely allows us all to focus on one of the most important aspects: the clothes, of course. While the kids were dressed in <a href=# rel=noopener>white tees and jeans</a> in one photo and variations on all-white in another (Yes, there were&nbsp;two photos, folks!), <a href=# id=auto-tag_jennifer-lopez data-tag=jennifer-lopez>Jennifer Lopez</a> went a slightly different route. She still wore white, but her Tory Burch dress featured the most stunning embroidery to give it a little oomph. Safe to say, I’m obsessed.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2150153365-e1714067157712.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/spraying-hair-adobe_954909.png><p>To make it even&nbsp;better, J.Lo finished the look with some platform Coach boots that scream fall. While the Tory Burch dress is very much a summer vibe, the boots bring the outfit seamlessly into fall—making it the perfect transitional ensemble. Catch me sporting a <a href=# rel=noopener>white dress and tall brown boots</a> every day now.</p><p>There’s just something about the combination of a summery frock and fall boots that makes me wish the temperatures would never drop. You still get the look of autumn in the form of gorgeous shoes, but the feeling of summer never fully escapes. It’s as if—even for a moment—you’re able to live in both seasons and once. Has J.Lo cracked the code on <a href=# rel=noopener>transitional fashion</a>? All signs point to yes.</p><p>Thankfully, we can all get Jennifer Lopez’s family photo look for ourselves. The pieces worn by J.Lo are definitely a bit pricey (She did&nbsp;not spare any expense when dressing for this portrait!), but we’ve included a couple similar items, too, for those of us who need to save some pennies. No matter your budget, though, you can get the same effortlessly gorgeous <a href=# rel=noopener>summer-to-fall transitional look</a> as Jennifer Lopez—and that’s honestly all we can ask for these days.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

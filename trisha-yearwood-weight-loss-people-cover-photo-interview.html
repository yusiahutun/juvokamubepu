See her top weight-loss tips below.</p><h3>Trisha Yearwood’s Weight Loss — Her Best Tricks</h3><p id=content-paragraph-2>“In the very beginning I was pretty strict. I didn’t give myself too many choices. It was grilled chicken and egg white omelets.” But she quickly learned that balance and moderation are the main factors in any healthy lifestyle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I’m not a sweet person, but when I started watching my sugar I found I wanted dark chocolate. I like dark chocolate, so I’ll break off a little piece when I have a craving.”</p><h3>There’s No Such Thing As A Get-Slim-Quick Diet</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although all these get-slim-quick diet schemes appeal to our senses, these&nbsp;gimmicks&nbsp;are not the answer. Trisha knows this first hand because she has been out there and tried it all.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I don’t think you can name one diet I haven’t done. I’m that girl who buys every magazine where somebody’s lost 30 lbs.,” said Trisha&nbsp;“I designed my own plan that’s low-fat, low-sugar 90 percent of the time,” says the country star.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>But that other 10 percent of the time, she gives into her cravings!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“If I’m on my way home and starving and I see a fast-food restaurant, nine times out of 10 [I’ll eat at home]. That 10th time I’m going for the fast food! There’s no way you will never fall off the wagon.”</p><h3>Dieting The Right Way</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>The country signer drastically toned down her eating&nbsp;habitats&nbsp;but still allows herself to indulge in the foods she love from time to time. Although she knows that the portions must be in moderation and she has to work it off the next day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I guess a part of me didn’t want to hear that it’s just really hard work!&nbsp;I have a strength I never had before. I feel like I can do anything.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>Hollywoodlifers</strong>, let us know what you favorite weight-loss methods are in the comments below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>—&nbsp;Brittany Chanel Jackson</strong></p><h3>More Celebrity Weight Loss News:</h3><li>Jennifer Hudson Disses Jessica Simpson’s Weight Loss</li><li><a href=#>How Kourtney Kardashian Lost 44 Pounds In 6 Months After Giving Birth</a></li><li><a href=#>Kelly Osbourne Reveals: How I Lost 70 Pounds</a></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH11e5BxZq2qmai1onnYnpirr5%2BksW7DxKKeoaxdoby0v4ypnKionJp6pLvVnqlmqJikwbB5yKernqqmnrK4ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./priscilla-block-2022-acm-awards-nomination-interview.html><span>←</span><span>Priscilla Block Overcome With Emotion After Earning First ACM Nom</span></a>

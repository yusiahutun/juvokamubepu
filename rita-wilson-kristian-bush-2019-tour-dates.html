She recently debuted her fourth studio album,&nbsp;Halfway&nbsp;to Home. Wilson co-produced the project alongside Nathan Chapman, and Bush is among the songwriters who contributed to the album.</p><p>Wilson and Bush teamed with Liz Rose to co-write one of the standout songs on the album, "Throw Me a Party,"&nbsp;which was inspired by Wilson's real-life experience with cancer.</p><p>“I had been diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago, and when I got the diagnosis, I didn’t know what the prognosis was going to be,” Wilson tells&nbsp;<a href=#>Taste of Country Nights</a>. “I got scared and I said to my husband (Tom Hanks) that, ‘Look, if something happened to me and I should go before you, please be sad for a very long time, but first, I want a party. I want to have a celebration.' So I had this title, ‘Throw Me a Party.'”</p><p>Bush is notably one half of Sugarland&nbsp;and is also a solo artist, playwright, podcast host and songwriter. The Grammy winner got his start in the music industry in the Atlanta-based duo Billy Pilgrim.</p><p>In 2015, Bush released his solo debut album, Southern Gravity, which featured the Top 20 single “Trailer Hitch.” Bush will continue to tour with Jennifer Nettles in Sugarland this year and will be releasing a new solo EP this summer.</p><p><strong>Rita Wilson and Kristian Bush's 2019 Tour Dates:</strong></p><p>June 5 — Atlanta, Ga. @ Center Stage Theater<br>June 9 — Nashville, Tenn. @ City Winery Nashville<br>June 11 —&nbsp;Washington, D.C. @ City Winery DC<br>June 12 — New York, N.Y. @ City Winery New York<br>June 14 — Huntington, N.Y. @ The Paramount<br>June 15 — Montclair, N.J. @ The Wellmont Theater<br>June 17 — Boston, Mass. @ City Winery Boston<br>June 19 — Munhall, Penn. @ Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall</p><p><strong>Country Stars Who've Been Touched by Cancer</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq6Gklnq4tcuspqdlm6e2tMDImqVmmqWotW5%2Bj2pwZqyfqr9usMCtnKxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-nicola-peltz-family-dislike-brooklyn-beckham-tattoos.html><span>←</span><span>Why Nicola Peltz's family may disapprove of Brooklyn Beckham's tattoo tributes to his wife</span></a>

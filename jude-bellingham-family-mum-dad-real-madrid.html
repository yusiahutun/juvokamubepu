Think a non-league <a href=#>Pele</a>.</p><p>While he played football, Mark worked for West Midland Police as a sergeant.</p><p>"We talk about footballing heroes, and my dad was like my first," Jude told <a href=#>the FA</a> website in 2021.</p><p>"When you go and watch him play every week in non-League, you know it's not the Premier League or anything, but seeing the way that he played and the atmosphere, it made me fall in love with football so he was probably my first hero.</p><p>"After the first few times of going, I’d start to pay a bit more attention to the games and stuff, the atmosphere and he's scoring goals so you see him celebrating and stuff like that - you want that to be me.</p><p>"Growing up, he'd always give me tips on what I could do and now it gets to a certain age and it sort of flips and that's brilliant because we have that sort of relationship like father and son and then as I got older, like coach and player."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-30-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/members-haile-selassie-peace-foundation-777412171.jpg><p>Mark is now Jude's agent and acted as his representative in dealings with Real Madrid as he embarks on a new journey.</p><h2>Following in his footsteps..</h2><p>Jude's path has seen him become an integral part of the England set up, a success story in Germany with <a href=#>Borussia Dortmund</a>, where he was recently named Bundesliga player of the season, and now a Los Blancos galactico.</p><p>But back in Stourbridge, his <a href=#>younger brother Jobe</a> is starting to make a name for himself.</p><p>Comparing his career to his dad's, <a href=#>17-year-old Jobe</a> once said: "If I get anywhere near that I’ll have had a great career.

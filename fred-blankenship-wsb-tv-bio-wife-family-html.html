With the belief that Fred has in his father, he never stopped working hard for his dreams of becoming a reporter.&nbsp;</p><p>Fred began his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">career</a> by working at KRON in San Francisco and then at KAKE TV in Kansas where he 'chased storms' regularly to develop his skills on weather coverage.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, he served as a reporter and a weekend anchor at San Diego's KGTV for six years where he received awards for his noteworthy stories such as drug prevention and community outreach.&nbsp;He also covered reports on the largest fires of the state as well as the Democratic National Convention in Boston in 2004. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Later, in the year 2007, Fred moved to Atlanta and&nbsp;joined the WSB-TV team.

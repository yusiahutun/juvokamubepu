The decades-long lovebirds have defied the odds and stuck with each other for more than 35 years, and it’s been quite the journey.</p><p>Although the pair have never walked down the aisle together, that hasn’t made a difference in their relationship. The duo — who started dating in 1983 — have managed to become one of the most respected and iconic couples in Hollywood. One thing Kurt loves about his lady is that she likes to dance for him any time of day.</p><p>“Every now and then, the mood will strike her, and <a href=#>Goldie starts dancing for Kurt</a>,” an insider told Closer Weekly in April 2020. “It may be in the living room, the bedroom or the hallway. She’s still got all the right moves and he loves it. Sometimes he even joins her!”</p><p>The Thing actor and the Sntached actress have learned a lot about what it takes to maintain a longtime romance, and Goldie shared a little bit of her helpful relationship advice while chatting with <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight </a>in May 2020. “Be patient,” the beloved star proclaimed. “That’s a great quality to develop and I think this is what helps relationships sustain … because they’re not easy.”</p><p>Considering Goldie and Kurt have stayed strong after all these years, they see <a href=#>no point in saying “I do</a>.” Though the <a href=#>Overboard</a> alums were both previously married — Goldie was wed to ex-husbands <a href=#><strong>Bill Hudson</strong></a> and <strong>Gus Trikonis</strong>, while Kurt married former spouse<strong> Season Hubley</strong> — they don’t need a “marriage certificate” to prove how much they love each other.</p><p>“For people like us, the marriage certificate wasn’t going to create anything that otherwise we wouldn’t have,” the hunk told <a href=#>People</a> in December 2020. “I don’t know. [Nearly] 40 years isn’t enough to finally say, ‘Well I guess … .’”</p><p>Goldie doesn’t mind their unofficial status either because “it’s not about the marriage,” she chimed in during their joint interview. “It’s about the people and the relationship, and the will to stay together. And that’s a big one because if you want it, you can have it.”</p><p><strong>For a complete timeline of Goldie and Kurt’s romantic relationship, scroll through the gallery below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46krKusXafCtL%2FEpaNmmZ6Zeqi7y52gnmWYlsSvv4yrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmrJmisq21zZ5koZmmmnqiecuopqRn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hulu-comedy-shrill-pen15-ramy-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Hulu Got Serious About Comedy</span></a>

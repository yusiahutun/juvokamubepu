involvement in the Brit girl's fate.</p><p>But Ken said he knew him in 2007 when Brueckner was living in and around the Algarve resort of Praia du Luz from where Madeleine vanished.</p><p>The former Greater Manchester community champion himself quit the UK to Portugal with his wife in 2004 after entering witness protection when a police blunder led to his name being handed to suspected criminals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32172879.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_FRANCE-JUSTICE-CRIME-POLICE.jpg><p>He had given police information about a gangland murder in which the suspects were cleared - resulting in him and his family getting death threats.</p><p>After being awarded £130,000 in compensation over the police gaffe the Ralphs hid out in the Algarve in a campervan moving from place to place like Brueckner.</p><p>According to Ken, Brueckner and a mutual acquaintance who cannot be named for legal reasons set up a hidden encampment in Carrapateira 10 miles from Praia da Luz.</p><p>A week before Madeleine vanished Ken said the acquaintance sobbed around a campfire as he told him Brueckner had revealed he planned to kidnap a girl and sell her to a family to make quick money.</p><p>"He told me Christian was planning to take a child from Praia da Luz,'' Ken said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>"He told me Christian knew many people who will pay good money for a child who cannot give birth and that the child would be taken from a rich family with more than one child so the parents would not grieve as badly.</p><p>"He then clarified it was not ransom but that it was to take a child to sell to a German couple who could not have children of their own. He assured me the child would not be harmed.''</p><p>The acquaintance told him Brueckner `worked at the restaurant and that he had been planning events for months'.</p><p>"He said Christian knows the place inside out and was very clever and he knows what he is doing,'' Ken added.</p><p>Ken said he tried to convince the mutual acquaintance not to get involved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29748357.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Missing-Madeleine-McCann.jpg><p>But a week later - while back in the UK visiting his dad - Ken saw news of Madeleine's disappearance breaking on TV.</p><p>"First thing I said was, 'oh for f*** sake,'' he said. "My dad asked what's the matter and I told my dad.''</p><p>Due to his previous police experience he reported it not in Manchester but to the Cumbria force - handing them a hand-drawn map of the location of the trio's Algarve campsite.</p><p>On his return to Portugal days later he went straight to the site only to find that it had been destroyed by fire - but for a 5ft bamboo cage.</p><p>He said he tried to find the acquaintance but was told he had gone to Africa and has not spoken to him since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32239450.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Screenshot-2024-02-08-at-110902-2.jpg><p>When police tracked down the man he denied ever meeting the Brit.</p><p>Though Ken said he told two officers from Portugal's National Republican Guard his information they refused to believe the acquaintance had been involved.</p><p>As police searched for Madeleine he said he went to the Ocean Club and was `gobsmacked' to see Brueckner nearby wearing an apron.</p><p>"This man was standing there in his restaurant pinny still working for them illegally at the restaurant which could have put further people at risk,'' he said.</p><p>"He was a good looking lad. He was slick, his hair was combed back, nice and tidy. He looked very clean. He spoke very well - posh English. He seemed very educated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30093721.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Missing-Madeleine-McCann.jpg><p>"I didn't have any reason to think he was the monster I've since learned him to be. He's a monster in disguise.''</p><p>Madeleine vanished after her parents left her sleeping in the same room as her then two-year-old twin siblings while they dined with seven Brit pals in the nearby tapas bar.</p><p>The group took it in turns to check on each other's children every half-hour.</p><p>In her best-selling book about her daughter's disappearance Kate said she feared someone could have rumbled their plans because details of their block restaurant booking had been left in a staff message book sitting on a reception desk.</p><p>``To my horror I saw that, no doubt in all innocence and to explain why she was bending the rules a bit, the receptionist had written the reason for our request...we wanted to eat close to our apartments as we were leaving our young children alone there and checking on them intermittently,'' the mum wrote.</p><p><b><i>For the latest breaking news and stories from around the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>here</a>.</i></b></p><p>According to since released police files all Ocean Club workers were interviewed by police at the time.</p><p>But Ken said if Brueckner was working at the restaurant off the books he could have been missed by investigators.</p><p>He contacted police again in 2020 when Brueckner was officially named as a suspect only to be told officers had no record of his original statement.</p><p>Ken said though he hoped Madeleine could still be alive he feared she may have been `disposed of' after it was publically revealed she had a distinctive fleck in her eye which would have made her easily recognisable and a `liability' to her kidnappers.</p><p>Cumbria Police said it had no record of Ken's 2007 statement, German prosecutors declined to comment and Scotland Yard said it had nothing to add.</p><p>The Ocean Club, which has changed hands since Madeleine's disappearance, had not responded to a request for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwuMCtnKysXaOyuL%2BOppidnZyatq%2BxjKaanJmeo3q0wdKpnJysXay8s7fIp55moJ%2BhtqWt2GZqa2pjboByfg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./le-havre-ac-21-football-club-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Le Havre Ac: 21 Football Club Facts</span></a>

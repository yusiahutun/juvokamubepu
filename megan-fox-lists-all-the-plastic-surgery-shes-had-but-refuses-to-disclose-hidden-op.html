These include any kind of facelift, and threads, although she is tempted to have her “eyebrows snatched all the way”.</p><p>She’s also never had any fat removed, including buccal fat, and says because of her lean body shape, she’ll never take fat out, only put it in. No liposuction, body contouring or BBLs have been had by the 37-year-old either.</p><p>So, what has she done? Well, she had her boobs done when she was around 21-22, and admitted to getting them redone after she was ‘done breastfeeding her kids’.</p><p>“I don’t know where they went, but they went,” she joked.</p><p>“I had my nose done when I was in my early twenties,” the Jennifer’s Body star revealed after being accused of having 6-8 rhinoplasty surgeries.</p><p>The star also admitted to getting Botox and filler, but concluded by saying, “There’s one thing I had done that I’m gatekeeping because it was really good and it’s not a known plastic surgery.”</p><p>Of course, the internet tried to guess what it was she had done as many are convinced it’s a Blepharoplasty, which removes excess skin from the eyelids.</p><p>We guess we’ll never know, for now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1463261963-1024x744.jpg><p>As well as opening up about her surgeries, Megan also gave a vague update on her <a href=#>relationship with MGK</a>, whose real name is Colson Baker.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> started dating in 2020, and became engaged two years later, after roughly a year and a half of dating. Although they did spark breakup rumors in 2023. Despite being seen together earlier this year, Fox’s cryptic update looks like they may have gone their separate ways.</p><p>“I think that what I’ve learned about being in this relationship is that it’s not for public consumption,” she told host Alex Cooper. “As of now, I don’t have a comment on the status of the relationship per se.</p><p>“What I can say is that is what I refer to as my twin soul, and there will always be a tether to him no matter what. I can’t say for sure what the capacity will be but I will always be connected to him somehow.”</p><p>The 37-year-old then said she was “not willing to explain” beyond that.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2d%2BcLnEoJinZZakxW64yKyrrGWRobluwMeeZKmkkajBqq%2BMrKyrn5Wnxm6%2Fx56qZqCRmXqjwdNmqZ6epaiytHnTqGSdoaOYubC%2FxGafopyUmrtuu89o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-swallowed-in-the-sea-by-coldplay.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of SWALLOWED IN THE SEA by Coldplay</span></a>

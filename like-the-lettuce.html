“No. And then you scoop out a tomato and you put it in the bottom and bake an egg in it.”

But, I’ve had a whole week of errands, working late and after-work engagements and I haven’t had a single home-cooked anything since those <a href=#>wee tartlets</a> and I was fiending for the kitchen by Saturday morning. Fiending.</p><p>Even walking to the store, I was wondering what I was getting into. Remembering <a href=#>Luisa’s horrendous spinach pesto</a> experience, I wondered how the flavor of ground up Romaine lettuce could be any less flat, and to be honest, I’m not sure I see the point in making pesto with anything but basil because why mess with what works splendidly? Are we really that desperate for new foods to eat? But, I followed through and we are both <i>very</i> glad that I did.</p><p><a href=# title="the rest of us will salivate"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/static.flickr.com/97/238519856_ba539b32b3.jpg width=500 height=333 alt="romaine pesto and egg-stuffed tomatoes" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The pesto really surprised me; that single clove of garlic, parsley and seasoning packed more flavor than I thought it would, but it was subtle enough not to overwhelm the tomato or eggs. (Alex said it tasted “green,” a word he also uses to describe the smell of my Aveda shampoo. I have only a vague understanding of what it means.) We liked it enough to spread some extra on ciabatta toast. I drew the line, though, at sautÃ©ing the lettuce like greens with pancetta, as even the photo accompanying the recipe made it look like slimy mess. I instead crisped up some prosciutto in a pan, my favorite form of “bacon”, and the whole thing came together pretty quickly. I’m totally saving this one for next time I have people over for brunch, and also as a reminder that sometimes, my hunches are wrong in a good way.</p><p><a href=# title="I admit I am disappointed my picture did not come out like the one that lured me in in Gourmet; what are they, professionals or something?"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/static.flickr.com/92/238519844_608c801d9a.jpg width=500 height=334 alt="romaine pesto and egg-stuffed tomatoes" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>Romaine Pesto and Egg-Stuffed Tomatoes</b><br>Adapted from <a href=#>Gourmet, September 2006</a></p><p>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>1 large head romaine (about 1 1/2 lb) *<br>1 large garlic clove<br>1/4 cup loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves<br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br>3/8 teaspoon black pepper<br>1 oz finely grated parmesan (1/2 cup), plus additional for serving<br>6 large tomatoes (about 3 inches in diameter)<br>6 large eggs at room temperature</p><p>Strip romaine leaves from stems, reserving both separately, then tear leaves into roughly 2-inch pieces. Measure 4 loosely packed cups of leaves and reserve remainder. With motor running, add garlic to food processor to finely chop. Turn off and add the 4 cups romaine leaves along with the parsley, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and cheese, then pulse until finely chopped. With motor running, add remaining cup oil in a slow stream, blending until incorporated.</p><p>Put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 400°F.</p><p>Cut off about 1/8 inch from top of each tomato with a sharp knife.** Gently scrape out pulp and seeds with a spoon and discard them. Put tomatoes, cut sides up, in a 9-inch glass or ceramic dish and spoon 1 tablespoon romaine-parsley pesto into each tomato (you will have extra pesto). Crack 1 egg into each tomato and season with salt and pepper. Bake eggs in tomatoes until whites are set and yolks are still runny, 18 to 22 minutes.</p><p>* I didn’t use nearly this much lettuce. For one, I was only making four eggs, and two, I had a hunch this would make an egregious amount. I may have used 4-6 leaves, tops, and half the oil and parsley.</p><p>** I ended up beveling a little sliver off the bottoms, too, to stop them from rolling over in the dish and dumping out their eggs, and you may have guessed happened before I came up with my brilliant solution. Next time I’d put a droplet of oil underneath the beveled tomatoes, as they stuck a little to the bottom, something I should have also seen coming.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-43 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-43 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.

Whether it's partying or <a href=# rel>going to Atlanta Hawks games together,</a> the former couple seem to mostly be on good terms. Sure, people online have their own opinions on whether or not Jayda should keep supporting Baby following cheating allegations. Regardless, the two still appear together often, keeping their post-romantic relationship afloat for their son and to just live more peacefully. Furthermore, a recent cameo in the Atlanta rapper's latest music video gives more credence to that idea.</p><p>Just this week, Lil Baby released and shared the video for his long-awaited track "<a href=# rel>Go Hard,</a>" which fans had already heard. It was one of the many leaked songs from the 28-year-old's catalog, and it stood as a particular fan favorite online. Despite what many might say online, his fans still ride for him heavily, and there's hope that he'll only improve from here. In the video, fans spotted Jayda Cheaves in the background, and people once again debated whether she should stick by his side.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jayda-cheaves-in-lil-baby-s-go-hard-music-video>Jayda Cheaves In Lil Baby's "Go Hard" Music Video</h2></span><p>Regardless of those discussions, she made it clear that she was leaving him via Twitter back in March of last year. As such, their relationship has a clear line that she doesn't intend to cross. "<a href=# rel>I’m finally standing up,</a>” Jayda Cheaves wrote on her Instagram Story at the time in reference to Lil Baby. “Everything comes to an end. Never force it. Be happy. I’m willing to [X] anybody out for my happiness and peace. I post my own [tea] so I can clown myself before I get clowned. Cuz shiddddd it’s cold out here. Ion know how this [s**t] gon go. Have a beautiful day everyone."</p><p>Meanwhile, Lil Baby is apparently moving on as well, or at least that's what much of social media believes based on some new pictures. Moreover, fans spotted him <a href=# rel>dining with Khloé Kardashian</a> earlier this week, which sent fans into a frenzy. Beyond conspiracies surrounding the Kardashian Curse, they expressed surprise at the pairing and now eagerly await a follow-up.

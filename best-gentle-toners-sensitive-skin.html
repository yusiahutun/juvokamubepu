For many of us sensitive skin sufferers, finding skincare in general that’s gentle enough but still actually works can feel like an endless feat of trial and error (and most likely, damage control). This is especially the case if you’re trying to find a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">toner for sensitive skin</a>, as toners are notoriously unpredictable when it comes their knack for stripping the skin—not to mention leaving it feeling uncomfortably tight. However, adding a toner to your skincare routine can be a great way to double cleanse, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">refine enlarged pores</a>, and even gently exfoliate. And, if you find the right one, they can actually be helpful for soothing irritation, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eliminating redness</a> and keeping pores clean and clear.</p><p>Table Of Contents</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=best-toners-for-sensitive-skin-at-a-glance>Best Toners for Sensitive Skin at a Glance</h2><p><strong>Best for Hyperpigmentation:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">REN Skincare Radiance Ready Steady Glow Daily AHA Tonic</a>, $40<br><strong>Best Brightening</strong>: <a data-pmc-sp-product=06d0fb1c60df97f2d133de6f00e4e36f href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"InstaNatural Vitamin C Toner","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"InstaNatural Vitamin C Face Toner, Brightens, Balances pH and Reduces Signs of Aging, Fine Lines and Wrinkles, with Witch Hazel, Lavender and Geranium Oils, 4 Fl Oz","price":"16.95","id":"B00NLKAVL4","category":"Face Care"},"id":1727006,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>InstaNatural Vitamin C Toner</a> , $15<br><strong>Best Alcohol-Free:</strong> <a data-pmc-sp-product=1bbe226cf98d113715bbf834ed440bf0 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Simple Kind to Skin Soothing Facial Toner,","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Simple Kind to Skin Soothing Facial Toner 200 ml (Pack of 2) by Simple","price":"11.99","id":"B00TUPTUP2","category":"Face Care"},"id":1727006,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Simple Kind to Skin Soothing Facial Toner,</a> $12 (was $15)<br><strong>Best Drugstore Find: </strong><a data-pmc-sp-product=bb05974e4531b2e97db3101d1b92f341 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Thayers Alcohol-Free, Hydrating Rose Petal Witch Hazel Facial Toner,","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Thayers Alcohol-Free, Hydrating Rose Petal Witch Hazel Facial Toner with Aloe Vera Formula, Vegan, Dermatologist Tested and Recommended, 12 Oz","price":"10.95","id":"B007HD570Q","category":"Facial Care"},"id":1727006,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Thayers Alcohol-Free, Hydrating Rose Petal Witch Hazel Facial Toner,</a> $11</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=why-toners-can-be-harsh-on-sensitive-skin>Why Toners Can Be Harsh on Sensitive Skin</h2><p>Many traditional toners actually contain alcohol, which, unless you have extremely oily skin, can do more harm than good. In fact, banishing all of your skin’s natural oils can not only cause premature lines to forms thanks to the tugging, but it can also actually lead to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>excess oil production and breakouts</a>, because your skin’s innate defense mechanism is to try to restore balanced moisture levels through more sebum production in order to compensate for the lack of (albeit self-inflicted) hydration.</p><p>If you’re prone to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>redness or have rosacea</a>, toners can be an absolute nightmare. While it’s normal to look a bit flushed after toning, if you have truly reactive skin, the aftermath can last for hours before going back to normal. Fortunately, there are plenty of alcohol-free options on the market infused with ingredients beneficial for sensitive skin, including aloe, rose petal, and lavender oil.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-to-look-for-in-a-toner-for-sensitive-skin-according-to-a-derm>What to Look for in a Toner for Sensitive Skin, According to a Derm</h2><p>According to Brendan Camp, MD, a double board-certified in dermatology and dermatopathology and dermatologist at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery</a>, “When searching for a toner to use on sensitive skin, look for ingredients that help calm irritation, reduce redness, provide hydration, and help maintain the integrity of the skin barrier.”</p><p>These ingredients include: <strong>glycerin, niacinamide, allantoin, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, and rosewater.</strong></p><p>Annabelle Garcia, MD, board-certified dermatologist at <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sonterra Dermatology</a> adds that those with sensitive skin should also look for an alcohol-free toner that is also gentle and fragrance-free.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-ingredients-to-avoid-in-toners-if-you-have-sensitive-skin-according-to-a-derm>What Ingredients to Avoid in Toners if You Have Sensitive Skin, According to a Derm</h2><p>As mentioned, avoiding alcohol and fragrances are two great places to start. And depending on the level of sensitivity your skin has, you might want to double-check with your derm about AHAs and BHAs. While these can help clear up acne and turnover new skin cells faster, some patients might find them too harsh, according to Dr. Garcia.</p><p>Dr. Garcia also warns about essential oils. “While essential oils can have various benefits, they can be potent and irritating to sensitive skin,” she says. “It’s best to avoid toners containing them.”</p><p>Luckily, there are a lot of great toners formulated specifically with sensitive skin in mind.

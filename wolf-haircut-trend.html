Typically, this hairstyle will offer shorter layers at the top of the head to enhance volume and texture with longer layers in the back, suggested Potempa. The results offer an edgy, almost undone, messy, rocker vibe.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-is-a-wolf-cut-for></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who Is a Wolf Cut for?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're after a shaggy, tousled look with a boost of volume, this is the style for you.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The wolf haircut is going to look better on someone who needs more volume and body, so most people with fine hair love this look on them, but really, it could be rocked by any hair type if you're looking for more volume for your hair," celebrity stylist&nbsp;<a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lovette Candice</a>&nbsp;told us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, if you don't enjoy hair that moves and has a more "lived-in attitude," this may not be the cut for you, noted Stenson.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you are open to a more tousled hair vibe and looking for a great way to spice up your look, you should try it out," he said. Also, this haircut works on all hair lengths, but Pompeo added that if you have shorter hair, the results will look choppier and more piece-y.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-ask-for-when-getting-a-wolf-cut></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Ask for When Getting a Wolf Cut</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gender-neutral haircut</a>&nbsp;can be customized in myriad ways depending on your preferences, says Los Angeles-based stylist&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Sharon Spellman</a>. "My top tip would be to make sure you're prepared on how exactly you want your haircut done and specify whether you want more or fewer layers and volume," Spellman advised.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since everyone has their own interpretation of a wolf cut, be sure to bring pictures of the specific style you're going for to your salon appointment.

Still, to minimize styling time, considering your natural hair texture is a smart move. For those with naturally curly or wavy hair, this cut is perfect for emphasizing your hair texture. Stenson says all you'll need is a leave-in conditioner and to let it&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>air-dry</a>&nbsp;for a playful, tousled look. Because these hair types tend to be drier, you may want to apply a spray like the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Matrix Miracle Creator Multi-Tasking Treatment Spray</a>&nbsp;($24) to help control any potential frizz.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Straight and Fine Hair</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have straight and fine hair, you may need the help of some additional hair products and tools to get that tousled look.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you tend to have flat hair, use a heat tool, like the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Beachwaver S1.25</a>&nbsp;($149), for a slight bend that will give the hair added texture," suggested Pompeo. After you've created the waves, you can add dry shampoo to add volume and sea salt or&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>texturizing spray</a>&nbsp;to make it look more like beachy waves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As there are no rules to styling a wolf haircut, you can also give yourself a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>big, bouncy blowout</a>&nbsp;if that's more your speed. It's all about enjoying yourself and experimenting with new ideas.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Styling the wolf cut can be so much fun because you can change up the whole vibe by the way you style it," said Candice.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-favorite-wolf-cuts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Favorite Wolf Cuts</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Jennifer Lopez</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@jlo / Instagram</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you don't want to give up your length, you don't have to with a wolf haircut.

If you prefer a more subtle take, ask your stylist to keep the layers on the bottom a bit longer than a typical wolf cut, like Lopez here.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Miley Cyrus</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@mileycyrus / Instagram</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most notable wolf haircuts seen today is Cyrus's iteration, which shows us that the choppier and messier the style, the better.

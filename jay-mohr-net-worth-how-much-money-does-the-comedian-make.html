The </span><i><span>Gary Unmarried</span></i><span> alum launched his career in the early ‘90s, adding more than 100 acting, writing and producing credits to his name since then. </span><b>Keep scrolling to see how much money he makes.</b></p><h2><b>What Is Jay Mohr’s Net Worth?</b></h2><p><span>Jay has an estimated net worth of $4 million, according to </span><a href=#><span>Celebrity Net Worth</span></a><span>. He kickstarted his career on MTV while hosting </span><i><span>Lip Service</span></i><span>, a lip-synch contest series. The Hollywood funnyman went on to appear as a featured cast member on </span><a href=#><i><span>Saturday Night Live </span></i></a><span>from 1993 to 1995. The following year, Jay scored a recurring role on </span><i><span>The Jeff Foxworthy Show</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The New Jersey native’s credits in the late ‘90s also include appearances in </span><i><span>Jerry Maguire</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Picture Perfect</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Small Soldiers</span></i><span>. In 2003, he began hosting and producing</span><i><span> Last Comic Standing</span></i><span>, earning an Emmy nomination in 2004 for his work on the series. Jay had a brief stint hosting the talk show </span><i><span>Mohr Sports</span></i><span> on ESPN, but it was canceled after one season.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jay-Mohr-Net-Worth-How-Much-Money-Does-the-Comedian-Make-.jpg><p><span>The </span><i><span>Scrubs</span></i><span> actor starred in the </span><a href=#><b>Clint Eastwood</b></a><span>-directed drama </span><i><span>Hereafter</span></i><span> in 2010. Jay snagged a recurring role in ABC’s </span><i><span>Suburgatory</span></i><span> and appeared on the sitcoms </span><i><span>American Housewife </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Mick</span></i><span>. In addition to his work in television and movies, he’s landed several <a href=#>standup comedy</a> specials of his own and voiced characters in a number of video games. Performing his hilarious comedy routines has always brought the performer bliss.</span></p><p><span>“I guess it was just the fact that there was joy,” he reflected on what attracted him to comedy in a past interview with </span><a href=#><span>Independent Philly</span></a><span>. “But the joy could have come at such an expense if it didn’t work. There was drama, like sports, boxing, car racing, but also joy, laughter; it’s a weird job. It’s the only job where people go to a room and wait for you to come out to give them an emotion.”</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Ghost Whisperer </span></i><span>actor has taken on several big roles in his lifetime but made a huge change in December 2022. He got engaged to </span><b>Jeanie Buss</b><span>, owner of the Los Angeles Lakers. The sports executive has a whopping $500 million estimated net worth of her own, according to </span><a href=#><span>Celebrity Net Worth</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Prior to his relationship with Jeanie, Jay was married twice, first to </span><b>Nicole Chamberlain</b><span> from 1998 to 2005 and then to </span><b>Nikki Cox</b><span> from 2006 to 2018. With Nicole, he welcomed one son, Jackson. During his second marriage, he became a dad for the second time when his youngest son, Meredith, arrived in 2011.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jmLJlnaS1s3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5x6iuZqWlmLVuuc6nnLJllKSytHnToZxmm5%2BisqW1wKdkppmbmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-tornabene.html><span>←</span><span>American TV Personality, Mike Tornabene Bio, Relationship, Instagram, Tattoos, Gian Hunjan, and Net</span></a>

Surprised by my unusually colourful appearance, she coos at my outfit upon arrival: "Look at you all dressed up – I love this new Anna!" I thank her for noticing because, truth be told, she has every reason to point out the change in me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pre-pandemic Anna would likely have met Rachel for lunch in flat shoes, a casual blazer and brushed-up brows, if time allowed. Minimal effort was her motto (despite my best efforts to channel the ‘other’ Anna via my Instagram) – anything more than an inch of heel height before 6pm seemed, at the time, a tad excessive. Pre-pandemic Anna also reserved hairspray, high heels and even colour (bright green Manolos? For lunch?!) exclusively for notable occasions. But post-pandemic Anna? Well, she’s a little different.</p><img alt="anna vitiello" title="anna vitiello" width=4000 height=6000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anna-dressing-up-2-1624963620.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Anna Vitiello</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For proof, see my wardrobe, where there’s one category that’s grown exponentially over the last year (and it isn’t of the leisurewear persuasion). Call it misled optimism in the face of stay-at-home orders, but my collection of ‘going out’ shoes seems to be on the verge of going out of control: specifically, that wonderfully impractical species of colourful, embellished, highest-of-the-high heels, usually reserved for big events or the glamorous days of Paris Fashion Week (during which some form of peacocking is all but mandatory). Most notable in its expansion, perhaps, is my ‘Amina shelf’ – a collection of bright, waterfall-heeled shoes by the queen of party heels, Amina Muaddi, in which I have been slowly but steadily investing over the last 14 months and now, in the face of freedom, will finally be more than just a display.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Post-pandemic Anna? Well, she’s a little different<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What hit me during the numerous lockdowns, you see, was pure nostalgia – for time with friends; for creating memories; for getting dressed up. No matter how hard I tried, no amount of matching loungewear sets or beautiful satin slippers could come close to recreating the sheer joy of donning my glitziest wares. Such was my nostalgia that I even felt an itch of sorrow for the now distant feeling of wearing a heel so beautiful that the balls of my feet almost cease to exist. I longed for the day that I could wear them again – appropriate occasion or otherwise. For too long, I’ve taken each opportunity for granted, grabbing for the ‘less dressy’ option at every turn, despite being blessed with a wardrobe 10-year-old me could only dream of.</p><img alt="anna vitiello" title="anna vitiello" width=2688 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anna-dressing-up-3-1624963666.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Anna Vitiello</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’ve often blamed my job for this – having a multi-hyphenate job in fashion along with a digital presence involves dressing up a lot (or at least it did, pre-pandemic) – and I’ve come to endorse an off-duty ideal that isn’t all that me.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>What hit me during the numerous lockdowns was pure nostalgia<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is where I’ve leaned heavily on Rachel for styling advice. As the one with the job in fashion, one might assume that I would be the one to dress up all the time; that I actually wear the many beautiful things in my wardrobe. But the truth is, I’m the one that has long looked to Rachel for her attitude to getting dressed. Throughout our many years of friendship, I’m yet to catch her looking anything less than beautifully put-together (even her workout gear is something to take note of) and it’s only now – bereft of any opportunity to emulate her effort – that I fully appreciate why she does so. A make-up artist to the stars, it’s not unusual for her to turn up to work perfectly coiffed, wearing some beautiful flowing dress and vintage Chanel sandals, looking more like the star herself, and I’ve often looked at her in admiration. "Why isn’t my job something to dress well for?" would be her rhetorical response to my quizzing her on wearing designer clothes to work. I’d never really had an answer, until now.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I was taught to save the ‘special things’ for worthy occasions<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Growing up, you see, I was taught to save the ‘special things’ for worthy occasions: my grandmother would bring out her bejewelled Christian Dior necklace only for the most memorable moments; my father saved his bespoke leather shoes for weddings only (a classic Italian Dad thing, it should be noted); my mother would keep her few ‘designer’ handbags wrapped in dust bags only to resurface – very briefly – on her birthday (and then to be stowed away again for years to come). The art of preservation has been ingrained in me from such a young age that I’ve long had a propensity for neglecting those so-called ‘special things’ in my wardrobe that actually bring me joy. I’ve long berated my father for looking scruffy in his everyday gear. Could it be that I was doing the same?</p><img alt="anna vitiello" title="anna vitiello" width=4000 height=6000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anna-dressing-up-6-1624963710.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Anna Vitiello</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Possibly, and I suspect that my fashion education has also played a significant role in the great under-dressing. Like many of my peers, I’ve been conditioned over the years to believe that it’s ‘chicer’ to be dressed down (Coco Chanel’s famous ‘take one thing off before leaving the house’ quote comes to mind here.) As an assistant in my early 20s, I used to turn up for long, labour-intensive days in the fashion cupboard in metallic tulip Dolce & Gabbana skirts (bought for £60 from TK Maxx’s gold label range, I was an intern, after all) and sample-sale bought Jimmy Choos. I was excited to get dressed in nice clothes to work with – and talk to women about – even nicer ones. By the time I’d left magazines, five years later, you’d have been lucky to catch me at my desk in something other than black trousers and a flat shoe. Dressing up, you see, was seen as something reserved for the ‘unserious’ – those with little else to do than care about their appearance. The serious, on the other hand, were far too busy to care about dressing up and – as a young woman trying to climb the luxury ladder – there’s little need to guess which camp I wanted to belong to.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I wondered what was wrong with dressing up?<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But staring at my shoe wall now (a display of my finest heels inspired by watching Kelly Wearstler’s 'Masterclass', another lockdown activity) I wondered who had made these rules in the first place. I asked myself at what point in my sartorial education did enthusiasm for fashion turn to embarrassment? I wondered what was wrong with dressing up? Even pre-pandemic, I’d never abided by – or believed in – ‘rules’ when it came to getting dressed (I think the rise of the tracksuit-heels combination would have been enough to make most tear up that book, anyway) yet I’d inadvertently absorbed the art of looking less nice.</p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="£540 at NET-A-PORTER for Amina Muaddi"

conclusions (replace ‘clothes’ with ‘people’ and they’re life-altering, too.) One: cherishing ‘things’ is as much about getting joy out of them as it is about preserving them. After all, how can they be cherished when they’re sitting in the dark, hidden in a dusty box in the back of your wardrobe somewhere? And two: there is no time like the present to wear the things you love. In 2021, there is no such thing as occasionwear – I make the occasions; I make the rules.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>My greatest lesson of all is this: there are no right occasions<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If post-lockdown spending is anything to go by, I’m not the only one. Revenge shopping – a term coined to describe the heightened spending on luxury post-lockdown one (read: taking back the power to spend) – goes some way to proving my point: life’s luxuries needn’t wait for a ‘special occasion’. In the lifting of a long shopping hiatus, we have rediscovered the uplifting power of fashion.</p><img alt="anna vitiello" title="anna vitiello" width=4000 height=6000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anna-dressing-up-5-1624963881.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Anna Vitiello</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for me, consider this my sartorial awakening. What was once tucked safely in the back of my wardrobe has made a triumphant return to the front (and what should have always been in the back has been somewhat unceremoniously relegated to storage.) Most pressing on my ‘to wear’ list are my crystal-bow mules, a new satin dress by Isabel Marant and all my vintage dresses from the 1980s that I’d been saving for the right occasion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But save I will no longer, because my greatest lesson of all is this: there are no right occasions, and waiting for one is about as fruitful as vacuum packing your wedding dress. And, anyway, if the greatest risk is choosing the wrong moment to wear something, I’m more than willing to take it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSudIKXcGprbWZkvbC%2F02anmqaUmrqqr4ydqZ6ro567qHnUqWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./422619-coptic-hospital-maternity-package-charges-nhif-services-contacts-html.html><span>←</span><span>Coptic hospital: Maternity package, charges, NHIF, services, contacts</span></a>

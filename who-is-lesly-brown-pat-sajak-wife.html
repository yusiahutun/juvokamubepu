She even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>posed for Playboy's "Women of Washington</a>" issue. She attended the University of Maryland and graduated in 1986 with a degree in television production.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-sajak-met-through-mutual-friends></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Sajak met through mutual friends</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>E.

However, the two didn't see sparks fly straight away. "There was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>no electricity</a> in the air," Sajak recalled in an interview with PEOPLE in the early '90s. He looked over at Brown and teased, "The subject of you didn't come up in my car ride home."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After their initial meeting, Sajak and Brown became friends. The two would talk on the phone and hang out, but "it wasn't romantic," as Brown told PEOPLE. Several months later, however, feelings started to develop.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-appeared-on-the-dating-show-and-it-made-sajak-jealous></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She appeared on </strong><strong>The Dating Show</strong><strong> and it made Sajak jealous</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Sajak and Brown were navigating their feelings, Brown was selected as a contestant on a reality show called The Dating Show. She ended up going on a trip to Mexico with the bachelor who had chosen her on the show — and that stirred things up with Sajak. "Frankly, I was a little annoyed at that," he told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There was definitely borderline jealousy. That was good," Brown said. It was enough to make Sajak realize that Brown was the woman that he wanted to marry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I knew she was the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with," Sajak recalled.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-sajak-got-married-on-new-years-eve></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Sajak got married on New Year's Eve</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the summer of 1989, Sajak proposed to Brown with a 3-carat marquise-shaped diamond ring. A few months later, the two exchanged vows in front of close family and friends at a Catholic church in Annapolis, Maryland. The reception was held nearby, in the backyard of Brown's parents' house. Sajak's Wheel of Fortune co-host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanna White</a> was also in attendance.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-both-of-their-kids-have-been-on-wheel-of-fortune></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Both of their kids have been on </strong><strong>Wheel of Fortune</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Maggie Sajak Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sajak and Brown are parents to a daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Maggie</a>, and a son, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Patrick</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2000, Maggie and Patrick made their first appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Wheel of Fortune</a>, where they closed the show and shared the advice their dad and his co-host White had given them. In recent years, Maggie has taken a more active role on the show, stepping in as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>guest letter-turner </a>in January 2020 and conducting interviews for the show's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>College Week</a>, in addition to various other appearances.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-her-daughter-is-a-country-singer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Her daughter is a country singer</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mike Pont/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple's daughter Maggie has had a passion for music since she was very young.

She released an album called If I Was Gonna Go in 2012.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to pursuing a career in music, Maggie attended Princeton University.

Sajak said to White on an episode of Wheel of Fortune. "So you know my son, Patrick, you've known him all his life. Well he's made it through medical school, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he is now officially Dr. Sajak</a>, and we're all thrilled."

I was in [a] fetal position, lying on the bed. They try to give you various drugs for the pain. And none of it was working.

I just had these beautiful pastels and lovely faces coming out of it," he shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Through it all, Sajak had the support of Brown, who never left his side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At one point in the interview, Sajak recalled thinking that he was going to die.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I felt badly for [my family].

The <a href=#>rock band</a> has sold over 15 million records in the United States of America alone.</p><p class=align-left>On top of being the band's frontman, Bret has numerous <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">solo albums</a> to his credit. One of the most popular is the soundtrack album to the 1998 movie, <i>A Letter from Death Row.</i></p><p class=align-left>Bret was born in Chicora, Pennsylvania, on March 15, 1963. This means that the talented musician is 63 years old. Bret grew up in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania and attended Mechanicsburg Area Senior <a href=#>High School</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Michaels started playing the guitar as a teenager and mastered the craft. He created a band with drummer Rikki Rocket, bass player Bobby Dall and guitarist David Besselman. However, Besselman left the band due to creative differences.</p><p class=align-left>The band changed its name to Poison in early 1984 and moved to West Los Angeles to seek fame on the Sunset Boulevard scene. And it has been an impressive journey ever since, with the band significantly impacting the music scene.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7998f7ef926c8a37.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where does Jack White live?

They had been having an on-and-off relationship but officially separated in July 2012.</p><h2>Is Bret Michaels bald?</h2><p class=align-left>Everyone has been speculating about Bret Michaels's hair, considering he always covers his head with a bandana. So, why does Bret Michaels cover his head?</p><p class=align-left>The 63-year-old singer admitted he is bald and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wears extensions </a>with his characteristic bandana and cowboy hats to cover his baldness. However, Bret has not revealed the extent of his hair loss, and he might likely be suffering from minor hair loss and thinning.</p><h2>What happened to Bret Michaels?</h2><p class=align-left>How is Bret Michaels’ hair now? It isn’t clear when Bret Michaels <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started balding</a> as he has been wearing his bandana for the longest time. Bret made his first break in 1983 when he was 20 years old. He is over 60 years old, and like most men in his age bracket, he struggles with hair loss.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/12848e793c7f1509.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bret Michaels' family: Parents, siblings, wife, and children</span></p></a><h2>Does Bret wear a wig?</h2><p class=align-left>Bret Michaels wears <a href=#>hair extensions</a>. He gave an interesting take on his hair during a 2008 interview after he was asked what he was hiding under his bandana.</p>My hair is combined with my hair and the finest extensions Europe has to offer. I do [Rock of Love] without it all the time, and they won't film me. They are like, 'Put your bandana back on. It is your image.' It is my signature thing.<p class=align-left>So, according to Bret, his management team will not let him film without his bandana because it is his signature look. Hence the consistent appearance in public with wigs and a bandana.</p><h2>How did Bret Michaels get his head injury?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/320d9038656ac768.jpeg><p class=align-left>Bret Michaels was hit with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">descending set piece</a> as he turned to exit the stage after performing at the 2009 CBS Tony Awards.

He was hospitalised for over a month. All this, according to him, was caused by his initial injuries at the Tony Awards.</p><p class=align-left>Bret sued the event organisers, claiming the injury contributed to the brain haemorrhage that nearly killed him. He blamed the network for airing the moment, which became a viral video watched by millions online. Bret eventually settled the brain injury case with the television network, even though they did not reveal the settlement details.</p><h2>What is Bret Michaels famous for?</h2><p class=align-left>Bret Michaels is famous for being the frontman of the American rock band, Poison. His signature look, always rocking a bandana, is part of his brand and has been of great interest among fans.</p><h2>Final word on Bret Michaels’ bandana look</h2><p class=align-left>The question, “Is Bret Michaels bald?” has been asked multiple times.

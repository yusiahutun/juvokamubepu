Hyaluronic acid locks moisture into the skin which is perfect to add to your routine if you have dry skin or as colder weather approaches. It also helps to boost collagen production over time. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Retinol</a> and niacinamide help reduce inflammation and soothe skin for a healthier complexion.</p><p>And finally, salicylic acid is excellent for troubleshooting stubborn acne. It works to clear out gunky and clogged pores to promote cell turnover and kill acne-causing bacteria on the skin. If you struggle with acne but still want the benefits of <a href=#>anti-aging products</a>, this all-in-one is the perfect option.</p><p>Shoppers who have tried it are raving about its benefits. “I was going to wait a full month before posting a review, but at approximately three weeks in, I have to say that this product is AMAZING,” wrote one reviewer. “My skin is translucent, the texture is refined, my coloring has become more even.” Another one said, “I’ll buy it again… and again, and again.”</p><p>It’s the perfect time to test it out since this product is currently on sale for 32 percent off of its regular price of $21.95. “This is <a data-pmc-sp-product=c9422e7b5f8ec0f06300d00297ae6195 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"my dream serum","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Eva Naturals Vitamin C Face Serum With Hyaluronic Acid - Anti Aging Serum - Reduce Dark Spots, Acne & Wrinkles - Retinol, Niacinamide & Salicylic Acid, Brightening Skin Serum for Glowing Skin","price":"14.99","id":"B01BT02Q88","category":"Supplements Deals"},"id":1307026,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>my dream serum</a> ,” wrote another shopper, adding, “I am 61, I do not suffer from breakouts, but had greasy sallow skin in my youth, which has left some open pores, and this serum closes them up.” Even if you don’t have breakouts, salicylic acid can help lessen the appearance of your pores.</p><p>The same reviewer went on: “I was also a sun worshipper when younger and have some sunspots.

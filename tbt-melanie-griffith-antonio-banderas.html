"I was pregnant when he was doing&nbsp;Evita. I was pregnant — I had just gotten pregnant, and I went with him. So the press made a big thing about how Melanie's watching over Antonio, and she won't leave him alone with Madonna because she's afraid that Madonna's going to — the "Material Girl" — will steal him.

Then why get married? It's, like, I would love to fall in love and have a romance, a relationship, but I haven't. I keep looking.

There was no figure given for the number of people polled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/08/e102f4b4-1c0e-11e7-b4ed-ac719e54b474_1320x770_194908.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other types of mood disorder include bipolar disorder, also called manic-depressive illness, in which sufferers swing between being “up” and full of energy and being deeply depressed; substance-induced disorders from misusing drugs or alcohol; or depression caused by an existing medical condition.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The fast development of the economy and society has speeded up the pace of our life and work and caused more stress among the public, which subsequently increases the risk of getting mood disorders,” Wang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although one-third of those suffering mood disorders were not clinically diagnosed with depression, they truly felt miserable and their social life and work was impaired, she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They have not reached the depression diagnosis standard, but they suffer persistent problems. This is a stage that the public must pay close attention to and get professional help to prevent sliding into clinical depression,” Wang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The World Health Organisation estimates that 1 in 10 people globally have suffered from major depressive disorders at least once in their lifetime and that, in China, more than 54 million people suffer from depression.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang Gang, president of Anding Hospital, a hospital in Beijing that specialises in mental disorders, said heredity played a primary role in contributing to nearly 50 per cent of depression, followed by pressure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The pressure can be chronic, unpredictable and uncontrollable. It is an important trigger for depression,” he said.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">For every dollar spent on depression treatment, society gains four dollars in better health and ability to workDr Bernhard Schwartländer, WHO</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unpleasant incidents characterised by loss, such as losing a family member or divorce, could also be a trigger.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Depression levies an unacceptably high burden on both the individual and society. In China, depression is estimated to cost the nation US$7.8 billion every year from lost work days, medical expenses and funeral expenses, according to the WHO.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The costs of depression are known.

No matter how restorative your hair oil or anti-damaging your heat protectant is, starting your haircare routine with a hair towel is crucial for healthy strands.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You might think, “Do I need to add another product or step-by-step system to my already busy morning?” But, adding a hair towel to your self-care regimen actually subtracts time instead of adding to it. Their moisture-wicking fabric cuts drying time in half, meaning you can shave several minutes off the time it takes you to get ready simply by investing in a hair towel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hair towels aren’t just your regular-old bath towels. They’re lightweight and deliver less friction, so they’ll spare your hair from damage. Plus, they’re comfortable to wear while doing other parts of your routine, like brushing your teeth. Sure, terry-cloth bath towels might be tempting to toss up on your head, but they’re rough and heavy, tugging on the hair when it’s wet and most vulnerable. But tamp down on frizzy flyaways or tangles? Your terry cloth could never.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-kitsch-microfiber-hair-towel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kitsch Microfiber Hair Towel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NocmBHy0C9y-IV8yWMuC8XeRlmk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kitsch-microfiber-hair-towel-wrap-for-women--hair-turban-for-drying-wet-hair-easy-twist-towels--super-absorbent-and-ultra-soft-microfiber-towel--after-spa-hair-towel-micro-dot--4d12438ef457413d8238bb397aa5ddaa.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Kitsch’s Quick Dry Hair Towel does exactly what it promises in the name: It speedily dries the hair so much that time can be cut in half. We especially love how practical, stylish and slip-free this soft towel has proven itself to be. The fabric is flexible enough to fit lengthy curls and full heads of hair, suiting every haircare need and it’s impossibly easy to use — just apply a mousse or a leave-in conditioner to wet hair, plop it in the towel and tie it up. And as a bonus, the styles are playful and on-trend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, polyamide <strong>| Size:</strong> 14.5” x 24” <strong>| Best For: </strong>All hair types</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-luxe-beauty-essentials-microfiber-hair-towel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Luxe Beauty Essentials Microfiber Hair Towel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=" Luxe Beauty Essentials Quick-Dry Microfiber Hair Towel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Qq9HRG7whHlT_R1l6wQbJ15iW1s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/luxe-beauty-essentials-microfiber-hair-towel-wrap-plush-microfiber-towel-for-hair--absorbent-microfiber-hair-towels-for-women-with-curly-long-thick-hair-60cbe482405846b09cac5efb0e2e80b8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a more affordable alternative, this lightweight towel from Luxe Beauty soaks up moisture just as well as the thicker options on this list. It drastically cuts down drying time and —&nbsp; for those with coily hair — does so while keeping your natural curl pattern intact. And for those with wavy or straighter textures, your hair will go from sopping wet to a manageable dampness in minutes. We also love how airy this towel feels on the head, almost like a shower cap. However, we wish the towel was longer to accommodate thick or super long hair better.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Microfiber <strong>| Size:</strong> 24" x 42" <strong>| Best For: </strong>All hair types</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-crown-affair-the-hair-towel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Crown Affair The Hair Towel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Crown Affair The Hair Towel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1uPZJcRPqPneaUImvAfbl853Bjk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/crown-affair-the-hair-towel--9f692be799eb472382d38fc67ce4f9fc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>When washing, don’t hang it dry by the elastic band, which will cause the towel to stretch and lose shape.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Crown Affair’s The Hair Towel is splurgey, but we think it’s worth every penny. It’s larger than your average hair towel, making it a terrific option for all hair types and textures — and personalities, too. This towel is a dream for lazy beauty routines or those who simply can’t be bothered to spend a long time styling their hair — it’s the secret for minimal input but scoring maximum output.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The waffle-weave microfiber sops up all the moisture from hair without needing to rub it dry, and the convenient elastic band ensures it won’t fall off your head or slide around at all. It also makes blow drying hair a snap because you’re already more than halfway there without doing anything at all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Custom microfiber blend <strong>| Size:</strong> 32” x 38” <strong>| Best For: </strong>All hair types</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thick-hair-volo-hero-microfiber-hair-towel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Thick Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Volo Hero Microfiber Hair Towel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Volo Hero Microfiber Hair Towel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8eWnEkxZ5O3WO_wu_JYfDDYBFvc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/volo-hero-hair-towel--d5bb06ae042c418ca80db27d44a940b3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Excess water, no more. This hair towel by VOLO is not only gentle and absorbent, but it’s also excellent at wicking away excess moisture. This plush towel is soft and cloud-like while secured on the head (there’s a strap to hold it in place), but don’t let the fluffiness fool you: Its nanoweave is 30% tighter than traditional microfiber, delivering a 50% faster dry time. Even long-hair skeptics will find themselves wrapping every last strand in this towel, as it’s lengthy enough to hold thick, long, and curly types.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Nanoweave <strong>| Size: </strong>39.4” x 23.5” <strong>| Best For: </strong>All hair&nbsp;types</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-microfiber-actacre-intelligent-hair-towel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Microfiber</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Act+Acre Intelligent Hair Towel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=" Act+Acre Intelligent Hair Towel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PcXiWiGNyWEdbIAH1Li_0lJDdSY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/act-acre-intelligent-hair-towel-5ce3c65f003f4bd2aed473c636b875b0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It could be longer.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hygge your haircare routine with this hair towel by Act+Acre.

Dubbed “skincare for your scalp,” the brand’s product line consists of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">scalp and hair</a> curations made for a variety of needs — from dry to oily and from thin to coily.

This seemingly average towel is next-level great, soaking up excess moisture in an impressively short amount of time. And we mean impressive: Even without wringing out the hair, it’ll be halfway dried in about three to four minutes. Celebrity hairstylist Jenna Perry, founder of Jenna Perry Hair Studio in New York City, recommends this hair towel for fine or brittle hair types because it’s smoothing and restorative, giving life back to dull, limp hair. So, if you’re looking for sleeker hair with less frizz, this wrap should be your go-to, as it’s designed to decrease friction, AKA the ultimate frizz-causer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Microfiber <strong>| Size: </strong>39" x 19<strong>" | Best For: </strong>Dry, brittle hair</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-curly-hair-pattern-microfiber-towel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PATTERN Microfiber Towel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=" PATTERN Microfiber Towel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/K7kpKt2qXZjP5hZa0I6wwkFaRoc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pattern-microfiber-towel-a3f9728038584ed79b3888b097df3a72.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For curlies, coilies, and tight textures looking to keep your curl pattern, you’ve come to the right spot. PATTERN, founded by Emmy-award-winning actress Tracee Ellis Ross, is a haircare line that focuses on fulfilling the unique needs of textured and curly hair. Everything from their tools to their styling products and accessories is designed specifically for hair that has any kind of bend, which is exactly why Ross’s towel earns our top spot for those with curly hair. It will enhance your natural pattern to keep curls defined and frizz-free.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, nylon <strong>| Size:</strong> 29.5" x 27.5" <strong>| Best For: </strong>Curly hair</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-long-hair-sienna-naturals-hair-towel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Long Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sienna Naturals Hair Towel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sienna Naturals Hair Towel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ELIf-LXtJquMbTqBYF9dDIgJjPE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sienna-naturals-hair-towel-50eb9db1e17b4f438746f594785a5c9c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sienna Naturals&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No stands will peak through this huge, textured hair towel by Sienna Naturals, as it’s three times the size of regular hair towels, meaning maximum coverage and absorbency. And despite being ultra moisture-penetrable, it prevents hair breakage, damage and frizz, all while cutting down on drying time. Although some brands might claim their towels are made from microfiber, they quite often turn out to be a blend of different fabrics, but this towel is the real deal. We also love this Black-owned brand for their commitment to using responsibly-sourced components for their products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> 100% microfiber <strong>| Size:</strong> 41.5” x 19” <strong>| Best For: </strong>All hair types</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-anti-frizz-ceremonia-hair-towel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Anti-Frizz</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ceremonia Hair Towel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ceremonia Hair Towel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Os6zjDCjgCFj_pxRuqxfne6cGwk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ceremonia-hair-towel-373d4b5ae8164bf6859a3baba2389c5f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It’s almost too plush.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Until I tried this Ceremonia hair towel, I was a non-believer in the brand’s “anti-frizz” guarantee.

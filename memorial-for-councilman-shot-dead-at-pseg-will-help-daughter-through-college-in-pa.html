My brother Russ loved and cherished his precious daughter, Kayla beyond anything else... Russ had made plans for his daughter to attend his beloved DeSales University in Center Valley, PA and she is scheduled to begin in the fall of 2023," Palazzo says.</p><p>The <strong><a href=#>GoFundMe</a></strong> campaign has raised&nbsp;$18,343 of a $50,000 goal from&nbsp;166 donations in its first three days, with the highest contribution of $1,000 from Peter Hugger.</p><p>His visitation will be held at the Johnson-Walton Funeral Home 24 Church Rd, Milford, NJ 08848 on Wednesday, Feb. 15, from 5 to 8 p.m. His funeral service will be held at the same location the following day at 11 a.m., according to his obituary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=#>Click here if you would like to contribute to the GoFundMe campaign.</a></strong></p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Somerset and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC6xLBko52iqLK6e9KopJ6qo5rBcLvBoquumaKesrR7zJ6kqKqZlrluss6rZJynpaOwqrjMmqVmq5ikwW6wxJqbZpmkYr20scZmrqKknGK1prjPZpuarZedwaa%2BjK2fq6elnLVur86lo56flWK2r3nPmmZxbWZsgnV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marcellus-wiley.html><span>←</span><span>Marcellus Wiley Biography, Wife, Net Worth, Wiki, Age, Football Careeer</span></a>

Goldstein’s tweet has received over 18 million views and spawned a variety of takes on the use of outsourcing technology to disrupting sectors such as the F&B industry.
One commenter wrote, “It’s kind of a no-brainer when you can pay this virtual worker US$5 per hour versus US$20 for a local, and this virtual worker is more grateful for the job while also treating the customer with more respect."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The Happy Cashier jobs are on a 12-month contractual basis, with no benefits such as health insurance, although performance incentives and tips are included.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet there are reasons why roles such as virtual cashiers still might seem more attractive despite the marginal increase in wages. Binghay described them as a “complex interplay of motivations” driven by high inflation rates, limited employment opportunities, personal aspirations, and global labour market dynamics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Key factors influencing this choice include the empowerment of working from home, which saves on commuting costs and enhances work-life balance; the flexibility offered by shift work, allowing for a better alignment with personal commitments; and job security, offering stability in an uncertain global economy,” Binghay said.</p>The <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Covid-19 pandemic</span></a> also accelerated the shift towards remote work and the popularity of work-from-home models as a safer alternative to physical workplaces, he said.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/05/02/chatgpt.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, Filipinos may also see the prospect of working for international companies as an opportunity to advance their careers and develop skills.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Filipino users shared on Reddit why they chose to go into BPO. “Working at a BPO can be fine depending on the account you land.

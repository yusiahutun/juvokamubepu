The summit will bring some of the world’s wealthiest families to the Palace Museum to discuss wealth management, the arts, green finance and charity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A lot of our clients have what we call passion assets, including yachts, planes or art,” said Jyrki Rauhio, regional head of credit advisory under global private banking of Asia-Pacific at HSBC. “We have been providing services and solutions around these assets for several years in Europe, and we have recently brought the art financing product into Asia.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The art scene in Asia has obviously grown enormously in the last 10 years, but aspects like our financing are relatively new.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/21/cb13b20b-58e5-425a-957f-b4e11a63d00f_d61eb8c9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">HSBC will offer loans equal to about 50 per cent of the value of an art collection, allowing private-bank clients to leverage their art to finance other business initiatives. The art in question must be kept in secured warehouses with proper temperature and humidity controls, not displayed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are very active in this art and culture space,” said Maggie Ng Yuk-yu, head of wealth and personal banking for HSBC Hong Kong. “It is our ambition to help Hong Kong be a global hub for art and culture. We are promoting art on one hand. On the other hand, we are helping our customers mobilise their art investment.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Private banks including JPMorgan and auction houses such as Sotheby’s and Christie’s also provide art-secured loans from US$1 million up to US$150 million, according to their websites. HSBC is catching up with its rival Citi Private Bank which a few years ago introduced this type of financing tool to Hong Kong-based collectors.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Standard Chartered wealth-management income doubled after China border opening</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are extremely excited and energized by growth of the thriving art market in Hong Kong,” said Suzanne Gyorgy, global head of art advisory and financing with Citi Private Bank. “Hong Kong has grown rapidly to be one top three largest art auction markets in the world, and we are pleased to see that the major auction houses are continuing their expansion in the city.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Williams, recently appointed as Louis Vuitton’s men’s creative director, launched a new non-fungible token or NFT platform called the Gallery of Digital Assets in May last year, providing contemporary artists with a curated platform to approach the digital world. The exclusive dinner for HSBC Global Private Banking clients will follow a talk discussing that platform.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other events include a series of workshops for art collectors and local artists to exchange views as well as an exclusive tour at auction house Phillips in Hong Kong.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Credit Suisse gets China licences to build wealth and brokerage businesses</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong has the potential to act as a family-office hub for wealthy families to manage their wealth and succession planning, as well as how to pass on their art collections and achieve their charity goals, Ng said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong naturally has a very deep capital market and it’s connected to mainland China,” she said. “For Western investors who have an interest in going into China, Hong Kong would be a natural hub for them. With the government push to attract family offices and ultra-high-net-worth clients to come to Hong Kong, I am quite confident that we actually can get the family offices to come to Hong Kong.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfl66vt8innmaemaOur6%2FEaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtobWpnanypv8GcZKKmpp7Bpr%2BMoKmapZ2ueri1zaecq2Wgna6zvsSlo2avmaG5qq3MrGSmnZWpeqrA0mapopuYmsC1eceopaBlm6S7qHnCpaCepqSoeqrAjKKlraqfmcKksdJmmKus</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elise-schaap-typetjes-tv-kantine.html><span>←</span><span>Dit zijn de 9 grappigste persiflages van Elise Schaap</span></a>

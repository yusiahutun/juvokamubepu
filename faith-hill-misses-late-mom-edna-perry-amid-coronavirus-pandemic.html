She opened up about the special bond they shared in a <a href=#>heartwarming Instagram post</a> on Friday, May 8.</p><p>“Don’t wait another minute. Call your mom, today!!!! I lost my mom a few years ago and let me just be brutally honest right now. I need to talk to my mom during this time,” Faith, 52, explained. “My mom was a strong, smart, hardworking and pragmatic woman. Her strength came from her faith. She taught my brothers and me to treat everyone with respect and equally. She was frugal. Never wasting a thing. The very food that we grew up eating came from our yard because that’s what we could afford. She was a straight shooter. She spoke honestly, always.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shutterstock_editorial_9212749jl.jpg><p>Alongside Faith’s sweet caption was the cover art for her husband <a href=#><strong>Tim McGraw</strong></a>‘s new song, “I Called Mama,” along with a snippet of the country crooner’s tune. “Thank you, my love, for this song,” Faith wrote.</p><p><a href=#>Edna died from ovarian cancer in November 2016.</a> She was 80 years old. “As you may have heard, my mom passed away on Sunday and was laid to rest this morning,” the “This Kiss” singer <a href=#>said on Instagram</a>&nbsp;at the time. “While this is a difficult time for our family, we rejoice in knowing that she is in Heaven and no longer suffering. Thank you all for the kind words and prayers.”</p><p>Edna and husband Wesley “Ted” Perry adopted Faith as a baby. In 2006, the five-time Grammy award-winning artist told <a href=#><strong>Larry King</strong></a> that she was raised in a “good Christian, God-fearing home.” In fact, Faith credited her childhood with Edna, Ted and her two brothers as the reason she’s so successful.</p><p>“I was placed into an incredible home that I mean basically is responsible for the way I am today and the backbone that I have in order to do this for a living,” Faith gushed. “Which is a crazy, sometimes unstable world that this projects. But the most important thing to me is about my family and that was definitely taught from my mom and dad.”</p><p>Edna must be so proud of everything her daughter has achieved!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46fmKKsmGK1qrjLZqSiq6OawG64wK2cZqWfonqmsM2aZKmdoqfGbq3Moptmm5%2BnvK%2Bt1aKprqtdpa6vsMSmoJxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eighth-day-moisturizer-review.html><span>←</span><span>Eighth Day Reparative Moisturizer and $325 Serum Review</span></a>

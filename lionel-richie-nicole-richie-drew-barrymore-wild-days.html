We're dear friends, we're a part of this little girl wolf pack and I think Nicole and I have figured out how to have so much fun and then like pull it together and be really good moms."</p><p>"I don't even know how that happened. You know as parents you go, 'This is gonna be a disaster,'" the "Hello" singer said, before referencing some of the trouble his daughter would get into with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/tags/parishilton>Paris Hilton</a>. "Because Nicole and Paris, let's talk about it, when they started out, I mean if I lived through that I can live through anything!"</p><p>"I think also like we got it all out of our systems," said Barrymore, as Richie shared what it was like for him being a dad at the time. "So let me give you my side of the story, you all almost killed me," he said, "I'm so glad you got it out of your system. I almost cut my system off. I almost lost consciousness."</p><p>"Some nights I would get a phone call, 'Uh Mr. Richie this is the sheriff of so and so country. We have Nicole here,' and I'm thinking to myself, 'What did she do now?'" he continued. "'Well she went down the wrong way of the freeway,' and I'm thinking to myself, 'This is not possible, right?'"</p><p>Dear reader, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:de85e25a-3f4d-40e7-a9c6-63c2ef323c74 data-container-ref=toofab:article:908cec21-78bf-410a-8ea0-fed4364ecc0e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f3/5by4/2023/03/14/f30e7b6965254bffa4ac395fcaad767b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Paris Hilton Memoir Bombshells: Everything She Wrote About Famous Friends and Painful Past</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The "American Idol" judge joked that now, all he wants is "to find out is who's gonna pay me back for all that medication I took?" He added, "Someone said to me, 'How did you make it through all of this?’ and I said, 'I was somewhere between meditation and medication.’"</p><p>Despite their partying tendencies, Richie admitted that all three women -- who he's since dubbed the "biddy committee" -- have become well adjusted, responsible people who are great mothers and wives to their families. "It turned out perfectly, I don't know," he added.</p><p>"We turned out okay," the "50 First Dates" star quipped.</p><p>Now that Paris, Nicole and Drew are all grown with families of their own, Lionel joked that he’s more than ready for the trio to get "a little bit of parental payback."</p><p>Back in 2010, Nicole tied the knot to her husband Joel Madden and the couple have since welcomed two children, Harlow, 15, and Sparrow, 13. Barrymore herself shares kids Olive, 10, and Frankie, 8, with her ex-husband <a href=#>Will Kopelman</a>, while Hilton recently welcomed her first child with husband <a href=#>Carter Reum</a> via surrogate in January.</p><p>Tune in to watch Richie appear on "The Drew Barrymore Show" on March 30 on CBS.</p><a id=gallery-link-326f6c4a-9594-4750-81ff-57843b7ed9f5 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:326f6c4a-9594-4750-81ff-57843b7ed9f5 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:908cec21-78bf-410a-8ea0-fed4364ecc0e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/91/4by3/2023/03/23/91dd8e7ad4814d7b8adaa4cb16df25bf_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmbGhfobawusSlZKuhk522pnnNopqopJViv6qvx6KcZpyimsRursCrqbKln6eybsPIpZtmnJGuwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dominique-strauss-kahn-lawyers-deny-settlement.html><span>←</span><span>Dominique Strauss-Kahn's lawyers deny reports of settlement with maid | Dominique Strauss-Kahn</span></a>

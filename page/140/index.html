The reality star — who rose to fame on E!'s Mrs Eastwood & Company in 2012 — left nothing to the imagination when she hit the beach in Florida.
No doubt causing onlookers to take a second look, Francesca put on an energetic show as she ran up and down the beach in a skimpy two-piece.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lindsay Lohan Rehab Facility -- Surrounded by Temptation</h2><time>Feb 18, 2024</time>

We've all heard the stories: Kate Moss was spotted in an airport, Jourdan Dunn was scouted in Primark, Cindy Crawford was discovered while de-husking corn, of all things - a heavy dose of coincidence, luck and being phenomenally attractive was in play in securing the careers of those top models - but how best to catch the eye of agency bookers?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>It's a Wonderful Life's Child Stars Share Filming Memories</h2><time>Feb 5, 2024</time>

For the young actors of It’s a Wonderful Life, the fake snow that covered the four-acre Bedford Falls set on a California soundstage felt magical. “I have very vivid memories of the snow outside the house and seeing the beautiful Christmas tree in June and July,” Jimmy Hawkins, who played youngest Bailey son Tommy, tells Closer. “There was a really uplifting feeling doing the movie.”

UFC commentator Joe Rogan insists there is nothing fake about Jake Paul’s boxing credentials, acknowledging that the YouTube star has “dynamite in his hands”.
The 25-year-old American’s abilities continue to be questioned despite racking up an undefeated 5-0 record, with critics calling for him to face tougher opposition instead of ageing MMA stars.
“Nothing about watching him fight screams to me he’s in over his head,” Rogan said on the latest episode of his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The 'Toy Story' Movies Ranked, Including 'Lightyear'</h2><time>Feb 5, 2024</time>

The Toy Story franchise is a beloved series of movies as both kids and adults have learned to love this group of toys. While Pixar has plenty of other properties, Toy Story will always be its baby and Pixar treats it with care. Now, with Lightyear, the franchise is beginning to expand into spinoffs and possibly other endeavors.&nbsp;

You can’t go wrong with a framed plant print. Having a plant hanging in a frame in your room adds a sense of calm and nature to any space—even when you live in a concrete jungle or there’s no live plant to be found in your apartment.

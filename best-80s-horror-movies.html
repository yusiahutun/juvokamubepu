Thanks to some stellar special effects, A Nightmare on Elm Street is an exceedingly fun watch, and Englund's first turn as Krueger is nothing short of iconic.

Camp Crystal Lake has been closed for two decades following a series of unsolved deaths.

A slew of sequels have followed, and the current timeline ignores Halloween II altogether. However, Halloween's first sequel is a gruesome slasher that's a must for anyone revisiting '80s horror. Picking up immediately following the events of Halloween, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) finds herself in a hospital. However, it's not the safest place to be, as Michael Myers stalks and kills the entire staff in his search for his eternal nemesis.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Halloween-II-Jamie-Lee-Curtis/dp/B0044WQHYI/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action="WATCH NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">WATCH NOW</a></p><span class="css-1j6c095 eutn2uj4">20</span><h2 class="css-kr21rx eutn2uj7">Pet Sematary (1989)</h2><img alt="21 best horror movies" data-cy=slide-image-20 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/08-hbz-80s-horror-movies-pet-sematary-everett-1665421718.jpg title="21 best horror movies" width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Everett</span><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Pet-Sematary-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B00K3NEE56 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stephen King's Pet Sematary" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Stephen King's Pet Sematary</a> has been haunting audiences for decades, and with good reason.

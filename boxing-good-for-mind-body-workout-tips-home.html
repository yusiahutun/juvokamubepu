Flight is for prey –what happens when we get scared, we run. What do predators or people who haveto fight do – they fight. When you box, you hit the bag and train your warriorinstinct which unlocks a level of belief in yourself and a level of confidence."</p><p id=ep4Nkuf9cZps data-wc=59><strong>Can someone get the benefits of a boxing class at home?</strong>"Everything we do in studio, you can do without a bag as well as shadowboxingand calisthenics.

When your goal lacks foundation, you are destinedto fail. Now with that, those results don’t come instantaneously. What does isthat euphoric feeling and that chemical release of, ‘I was challenged. I feelstronger.’ When you eat right and train your body physically, you unlock thissense of self-worth and confidence you can’t read in a self-help book.”</p><p id=eWSfUOZWg0EB data-wc=85><strong>If someone has limited time to hit the gym, it's still worth it right?</strong>"The number one excuse for someone to not work out is ‘I don’t havetime,’ yet he/she knows every episode of or .

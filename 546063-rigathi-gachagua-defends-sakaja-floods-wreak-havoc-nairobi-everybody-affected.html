When they overflow and sweep people, they don't choose which side of the political divide they come from, they carry anyone around the river they affect everybody. We want to tell our people that elections are over and politics of divide is over, and it is time to work," he said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f803bf680f6a6fa.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nairobi: Renowned Activist Benna Buluma alias Mama Victor Dies in Mathare Floods</span></p></a><p class=align-left>His remarks came days after <a href=#>education</a> analyst Janet Ouko said the flooding in Kenya should be blamed on the United Democratic Alliance (UDA), for settling on Sakaja.</p><h2>Why blame UDA for flooding in Nairobi?</h2><p class=align-left>According to her, <a href=#>UDA</a> should take responsibility for the floods in the county, for settling on Sakaja, despite his questionable academic history.</p><p class=align-left>She said the party should offer the residents an apology for imposing the governor on them, instead of complaining.</p>"Voters have nothing to do with who becomes the governor in these big political parties. The least we are expecting from UDA is to take responsibility for the kind of leadership they have ensured at City Hall. We are not expecting them to complain to us.

And if you haven’t is it because your toes are looking a little worse for the wear? Good news: We found the easy hacks that ensure your feet look and feel beautiful all summer and the fun beach pedicure designs that will have you sand- and surf-ready, no matter where your feet take you.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The best hacks for sand & sandal ready — stat</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Remove calluses with a ceramide cream</h3><p>That rough skin on the sides of toes and bottoms of soles tends to get worse with each passing winter because of moisture loss in skin as we age, says <a href=# rel=noopener>podiatrist Suzanne Levine, D.P.M.</a> Her advice: Before bed, soak feet in warm, sudsy water for 5 minutes, then towel-dry and apply a cream containing ammonium lactate (which exfoliates), ceramides (which restore skin’s moisture barrier) and hyaluronic acid (a powerful humectant). One we like: CeraVe Renewing SA Foot Cream (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $13.41</a>)<strong>.</strong></p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Next, cover feet loosely with plastic wrap and slip on clean socks. In the morning, take off socks and plastic and rinse feet. Then while feet are wet, use a foot file in a gentle sawing motion to remove calluses instantly and painlessly.</p><p>Tip: If you don’t like sleeping in socks, just leave the cream on for an hour; repeat twice that week for similar results.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Brighten yellow nails with a denture soak</h3><p>Nail polish use, age and daily rubbing of toes against the insides of shoes can all cause <a href=#>nails to yellow</a>, says <a href=# rel=noopener>Anthony Youn, M.D.,</a> author of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Age Fix</a>, who specializes in low-cost DIY beauty remedies.</p><p>The surprising hero: denture cleaner — its sodium bicarbonate and citric acid help strip and “lift” the yellow tinge. Simply fill a basin with 2 cups of warm water and drop in a denture tablet, we like CVS Denture Cleanser (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from CVS, $4.19 for 40 effervescent tablets</a>). While it dissolves, dip feet in and soak for 10 minutes, then scrub toenails with a <a href=#>clean dishwashing sponge</a>. Repeat 3 times a week for brighter toenails within 3 weeks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Heal cracked heels with avocado</h2><p>Cracks along the heel look unsightly, and they can be painful too! Dr. Youn’s fix: Cut an avocado in half and scoop out the pulp. You’ll be left with the avocado shell, which fits perfectly over the heel — use it to rub each heel for at least 5 minutes to exfoliate away the top layer of dead skin cells.</p><p>When done, let the avocado residue on your heels dry — the omega-3 fatty acids in the pulp will moisturize and nourish skin. Then rinse feet with warm water. Doing this twice a week will soften heels in as little as 2 weeks. Bonus: Make a salad or<a href=#> guacamole</a> with the pulp you scooped from the avocado — the <a href=#>omega-3 fats</a> help boost skin’s hydration from the inside out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beach pedicure nail designs that wow</h2><p>Now that your feet and soles are soft and sandal ready, try one of these fun beachy designs.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1.

However, we do know she owns at least one property, reportedly acquired on lease.

The guest house also has its own set of amenities to give any guest lucky enough to grace it a taste of heaven.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/20220405_063014-1024x489.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Inside_Nicki_Minajs_Former_Home_In_Beverly_Hills></span><strong>Inside Nicki Minaj’s Former Home In Beverly Hills</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before moving into her current house, Nicki Minaj resided in a similarly lavish mansion in Beverly Hills along with rapper Meek Mill.</p><p>Notably, Mill moved out of the <a href=#>property</a> following his breakup with the crooner. The 11 bathroom property notably sat on the former site of Frank Sinatra’s home.</p><p>The Mediterranean-style home, located in a gated community contained a five-car garage. It also had a two-story entrance leading into the living room.</p><p>The home also flaunted a formal dining area, several family rooms, and a massive kitchen sporting an impressive breakfast nook.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/20220405_070322.jpg><p>Upstairs, the raper’s Beverly Hills property housed seven bedrooms with a private terrace and a balcony. Two more bedrooms and a shared bathroom are located downstairs.</p><p>Finally, her former abode had an extravagant guest house, connected to the main house through a balcony on the second floor.</p><p>While the star successfully kept her previous stomping ground private for a while, she was forced to move out following a burglary.</p><p>She also kept the location of her LA abode under wraps for a while. However, that changed after her husband, Petty was forced to <a href=#>register</a> as a sex offender in connection to a rape incident in 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>By implication, he listed his home address in the sex offender registry to avoid a 10-year jail sentence. Thus, once again, the privacy in Nicki Minaj’s little world became distorted.</p><p>These days, the icon is focused on nurturing her family comprising her husband, Kenneth Petty, and their son, whose name remains a mystery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kfnF5zKKjpaGfo3qpu9SsnGammZi4qnnMoqWaol2otaK%2BxKxkoa2jl66vsIyspqdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./business-owner-reveals-torrent-abuse-cancellations-feminist-writer-clementine-ford-published-details-pro-jewish-whatsapp-chat-html.html><span>←</span><span>Business owner reveals torrent of abuse and cancellations after feminist writer Clementine Ford publ</span></a>

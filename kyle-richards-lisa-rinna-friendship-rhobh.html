Obviously, you guys may know that." The "Halloween" star appeared to allude to her fallout with Rinna, who had been put in the middle of Kyle and her sister <a href=#>Kathy Hilton</a> last season.</p><p>"I texted her when I found out that she wasn't coming back and, you know, like I said, unfortunately, we had that issue," Kyle said. "But we'll get past all that."</p><p>The reality star said she's doing "fine," adding that she's "just moving on from everything, and I had to put all that behind me, honestly." As for filming the show without Rinna, Kyle said, "She brought a lot to the show ... and she'll be missed."</p><p>In January, Rinna confirmed she was leaving "RHOBH" after eight years of attention-grabbing drama and headlines.</p><p>"This is the longest job I have held in my 35 year career and I am grateful to everyone at Bravo and all those involved in the series," she said in a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://people.com/tv/lisa-rinna-leaves-the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills/>People</a>, "It has been a fun eight-year run and I am excited for what is to come!"</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>In case you somehow missed it all, during Season 12 of "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills," Rinna was involved in the now-infamous drama with Kyle's sister, Kathy, after she accused Kathy of spewing some pretty vile comments about both her sister and the rest of the cast during a drunken rant in Aspen. While Kathy apologized to her sister and Kyle seemed ready to move on, neither Rinna nor co-star <a href=#>Erika Jayne</a> would drop the subject -- and it really blew up<a href=#> during the show's reunion</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, in addition to Kyle, both Erika and fellow "RHOBH" Housewife <a href=#>Garcelle Beauvais</a> shared their thoughts on filming the Bravo show without Rinna in separate interviews this week.</p><p>While speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> at the <a href=#>Billboard Women in Music celebration</a> on Wednesday, Erika opened up about Rinna's absence, noting that "the show goes on."</p><p>"You know, I miss my friend. I do. But I know that she's off doing great things," she said. "She's going to be missed."</p><p>"But hey, the show goes on and we're going to have a great season. We've been together as a group three times and so far, so good," Erika continued, adding, "But that doesn't mean it will hold for long."</p><p>Beauvais expressed more cryptic sentiments about Rinna's departure during an appearance on Tuesday's episode of "The Sherri Shepherd Show,"</p><p>"I’m good. I'm good … period," she said of her co-star's exit.</p><p>However, she went on to admit, "You know what, listen, I'm gonna give her credit. She definitely came on the show and made her mark but now it's time for new."</p><a id=gallery-link-f1201c0e-9f3a-4b24-a2f9-99e3b83895b6 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:f1201c0e-9f3a-4b24-a2f9-99e3b83895b6 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:b1616dda-5ad5-4d80-ba1f-f0603f86c7b8 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/af/4by3/2021/10/15/af340ad2fcf64ad6a5f09f2895229205_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmaWpfoMatsYyroJygkaextHnLoqqaZaKeu6%2BtjJ%2Bpop2emcCptc9mqaGnkp18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./station-19-grey-damon-teases-9-1-1-crossover-jack-gibson-buck.html><span>←</span><span>Station 19's Grey Damon teases 9-1-1 crossover, reveals character he'd love to be Jack's 'best bud'</span></a>

While it may seem a far-fetched idea, given the amount of protection to which the royals are usually subjected, this really did happen – and the siblings were able to go incognito for a night of partying in the capital.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The Crown: Season 6 Part Two (Netflix)" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/meg-bellamy-ed-mcvey-the-crown-season-6-656a0db7ee8ba.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the episode, Margaret has to cajole her elder sister into a bit of rule-breaking, but eventually manages to persuade her to leave the palace, dressed in her military uniform (the future Queen was, in fact, the first female member of the royal family to join the armed forces in a full-time active role during the war). The pair are seen heading out into the jubilant crowds, accompanied by Peter Townsend (equerry to King George VI) and Lord Porchester, otherwise known as 'Porchie', who would go on to become the Queen's horse-racing manager.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Queen herself confirmed that the story was true in 1985, in a special and rare personal interview with the BBC. "We were terrified of being recognised – so I pulled my uniform cap well down over my eyes," she said. "A Grenadier officer among our party of about 16 people said he refused to be seen in the company of another officer improperly dressed. So I had to put my cap on normally."</p><img alt="'the king and queen with princess elizabeth and princess margaret on the balcony of buckingham palace on ve day', 8 may 1945 king george vi and queen elizabeth with daughters princess elizabeth future queen elizabeth ii and princess margaret rose, celebrating the end of the second world war raphael tuck amp sons ltd, london, 1945" title="The King And Queen With Princess Elizabeth And Princess Margaret On The Balcony Of Buckingham Palac Creator: Daily Herald" width=6132 height=3552 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1055137514-65830dbb44424.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>A young Princess Elizabeth (far left) and Margaret (far right) pictured with their parents on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on 8 May, 1945</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At around 8pm, it's said Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret asked their parents if they could break protocol to join the festivities and they agreed, as long as they were accompanied by a trusted group of royal household members – including Townsend and Porchester, as well as Margaret Rhodes (the Queen's cousin) and Jean Woodroffe (a former lady-in-waiting).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We crossed the forecourt at Buckingham Palace and got to the railings and there were these masses and masses of people. There was a general thing of, 'We want the King and Queen’, which we all frantically joined in with and were amazed when, five or 10 minutes later, the windows opened and they came out onto the balcony," recalled Rhodes in an interview with Channel 4 in 2015, describing what it was like for Elizabeth and Margaret to look up at their parents from within the crowd. "It was like a wonderful escape for the girls. I don’t think they’d ever been out among millions of people. It was just freedom – to be an ordinary person."</p><img alt="original caption ve day in london the crowd gathered outside buckingham palace, cheer and wave as their majesties the king and queen with the princesses elizabeth and margaret rose, appear on the balcony 8th may 1945 photo by © hulton deutsch collectioncorbiscorbis via getty images" title="VE Day Revelers Outside Buckingham Palace" width=3552 height=2792 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-613491086-65830df563a3d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hulton Deutsch</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Cheering crowds flooded London’s streets to celebrate the end of the war</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"We were terrified of being recognised – so I pulled my uniform cap well down over my eyes"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don’t remember who came up with the idea. We went out of one of the back doors of Buckingham Palace and headed up to the left of the Mall," said Woodroffe in the same interview. "There were lots of people singing and shouting."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The royal party moved to Whitehall and the Queen described remembering "lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief. I also remember when someone exchanged hats with a Dutch sailor; the poor man coming along with us in order to get his hat back."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At about 11.30pm, Rhodes said the group arrived at one of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/travel/a43398052/royal-family-favourite-uk-hotels/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="London’s most famous hotels" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">London’s most famous hotels</a>: The Ritz, a fact also mentioned in The Crown. "For some reason, we decided to go in the front door of the Ritz and do the conga. The Ritz has always been so stuffy and formal – we rather electrified the individuals inside. I don’t think people realised who was among the party – I think they thought it was just a group of drunk young people. I remember old ladies looking faintly shocked. As one congaed through, eyebrows were raised."</p><img alt="princesses attend tree planting ceremonies princess elizabeth left and princess margaret rose arrive at windsor great park england to attend the tree planting oeremonies commemorating the work done by british agriculture for the red cross" title="Princesses attend tree planting ceremonies; Princess Elizabeth (left) and Princess Margaret Rose arr" width=2444 height=1936 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-502829971-65830e1a47b63.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Toronto Star Archives</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The two princesses pictured later that year</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"For some reason, we decided to go in the front door of the Ritz and do the conga"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The two princesses ended up in the Royal Parks on their way back to the palace, and bore witness to some pretty extraordinary sights. "There were places like Green Park and St James’s, which one would never have walked through at night in the war – and there we were," said Woodroffe. "There was the usual thing of people kissing and hugging – and even making love. I was shocked by it – I hadn’t experienced that sort of thing happening before in public."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By midnight, an estimated 50,000 people had gathered around The Mall and the King and Queen decided to make a surprise second appearance on the balcony. The Queen told the BBC, "we were successful in seeing my parents on the balcony, having cheated slightly by sending a message into the house, to say we were waiting outside".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Queen's father, George VI, seemed to approve, and even wrote about his daughters' night out in his diary, calling them his "poor darlings" and adding: "They have never had any fun yet". Elizabeth certainly enjoyed her brief release from the confines of royal duty: in her interview, she described it as "one of the most memorable nights of my life".<br></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSyr8DEq6uaoZ6isq%2FAjpprb2lobYR0fY6qrJ6dnmK6or7GmqmerF2rsm6wwLJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-gen-z-k-pop-idols-making-waves-fashion-scene-le-sserafims-eunchae-and-newjeans-hanni-ives-wonyoung.html><span>←</span><span>5 Gen Z K-pop idols making waves on the fashion scene, from Le Sserafims Eunchae and NewJeans</span></a>

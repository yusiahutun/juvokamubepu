More people are getting into the game.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lennox went over in the right corner after four minutes. His second try resulted from a grubber kick that mischievously evaded the hands of Australia’s James Turner as it bounced behind the line. Lennox exploited Turner’s misery to ground the ball and create daylight between the teams.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are knocking on the door at every tournament, and hunting down Argentina,” Lennox said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is very fine margins [that decide tournaments], we have probably lacked a bit of discipline or control in certain parts of games, and you need it all to click to win.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As he talked inside the Irish dressing room, a tattoo of the Olympic rings was visible on Lennox’s torso. Ireland went out at the group stage on their Games debut, but this enterprising, spirited team is a different proposition from the one that went to Tokyo three years ago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Succeeding at the Olympics is everyone’s ambition, and I think we are putting ourselves in a great spot going towards Paris,” Lennox said. “That is the goal at the end of the season.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Australia were a husk of the side that scored 46 unanswered points against Canada and South Africa on Saturday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unable to lift themselves, barely three hours after their humbling by New Zealand, the Wallabies’ third-placed contest did at least provide an opportunity to hand a first start of the tournament to Michael Hooper.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong Sevens: New Zealand teams do the double, again – day 3, as it happened</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The test great, playing his first sevens rugby after crossing from the 15s code, was typically physical, but could not stem the Irish tide.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That was the most game time I have had, and it felt good, I had more in the tank,” Hooper said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We handled the first two days pretty well, but today was not our day. I don’t think we performed near our best, we let in a few points, and did not really get our attack flowing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/07/d171b261-891c-479e-855c-a78d144482bb_d21898c1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hooper said the butterflies that accompanied his debut as a substitute on Friday were “more controllable knowing you will be out there on the first whistle”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You know you will be receiving or catching, so can prepare for it … then let it all fly,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Has Hooper caught the sevens bug? “Yes, I enjoyed that,” he said. “I want more time on the field, and I just want to improve.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq62Xl8ZwtMpmqp6ulaPAcK3RraCcpJVkgHOBl2psb2eYpLuoecqopaBlo5rDprrSZqCrnZyWu6V5wKKkoqaXYravv8%2BiqZ5loJq8sbjEZp%2BopZViwKat0qilrGWjqr%2BxvsisnGaokZi4orPErGScpJGeum7Ax6KpnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./64149c4ee2704e6b608b45e3-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cmo solicitar la beca Jvenes Escribiendo el Futuro?

Still, in its seven years of existence, no member of Twice has released a solo track – until now. Nayeon, the </span><span type=text>unnie</span><span type=text> – or oldest member of the group – has just released her debut solo single </span><span type=text>POP,</span><span type=text> along with a mini album called “IM NAYEON”.</span></p><p type=p><span type=text>Here’s a few thoughts we had while watching the MV for </span><span type=text>POP</span><span type=text>, which racked up more than 30 million views in just three days.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><span type=text>Youthful summer go!</span></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>When the MV starts with a clear blue sky, we can already tell we are looking at this year’s summer anthem. The video features a classic, bright K-pop aesthetic and an ever-present sun shining down on Nayeon. The first few shots of the MV feature the idol wandering around an all-white village that reminds us of Greece, while the next main set is a doughnut shop, once again filled with bright pastel colours that remind us of the pure joy of enjoying something sweet in the midst of summer.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>There are a few other amazing sets that radiate youth and sunshine, including the background of the first chorus, which features the same bright blue from the sky in the opening of the MV and allows Nayeon’s red outfit to really, dare we say it, pop!</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=7f73b995-a208-49ff-b335-911bc3f442b7 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>11 phrases used by K-pop idols and fans alike</span></strong></a></p><p><h3 type=h3><span type=text>Outfits that match the vibe</span></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The outfits not only compliment the feeling of the song, but also Nayeon herself. She wears a total of 14 outfits in the MV, all of them well-styled. The first one featured – which also appears in later scenes – is a matching black and white top, shorts, and boots set. Another stand-out choice is a red spaghetti strap vest accompanied by a short jacket, which perfectly compliments the pastels and whites of the background.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>One fan favourite is a butterfly top she wears during the second verse; although it is glittery, it’s not too overwhelming, and it makes her look like a summer fairy ready to enjoy the hot weather.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Nayeon rocks a matching checkered set in her video.

It’s why some fans expected to see something different than the typical girl crush aesthetic in Nayeon’s release. But the Twice member stuck to her reputation as one of the most energetic members of the group who always releases an </span><span type=text>aegyo</span><span type=text> vibe – meaning she is cute and youthful.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>POP</span><span type=text> was nothing but fun, featuring upbeat snares that make you want to get off your seat and dance, and slight riffs of electric guitars that added to the song’s youthful energy. The instrumental to the chorus is also very dreamy and reminds listeners of feeling the cool summer breeze while dancing on the beach. These additions help Nayeon add her own taste to the song and remind listeners of her personality.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=b71960e8-a971-4a89-bcfa-9778f101f7ea data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>K-pop girl group NMIXX debuts O.O MV on YouTube: here’s one fan’s reaction</span></strong></a></p><p><h3 type=h3><span type=text>Staying true to herself</span></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The name of the album, IM NAYEON, it is a playful pun on both her surname “Im” in Korean and the word “I’m” in English, which is the singer’s way of showing the world what her solo act is all about. This MV is filled with her own flavour, from her natural charm to her positivity.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Nayeon has always been one to send warmth to her teammates, whether through her kind words or caring gestures. </span><span type=text>POP</span><span type=text> is a blunt but sincere confession of love, just like Nayeon herself, who has always been straightforward and honest in her words and actions. Her powerful vocals shine through the song and prove that she is unaffected by her haters.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxrF7w6KqnKemmr9wsc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWamraOesHCt0a2gnKSVZIByhJJwaWpnoKS9br7Er6Cer12pxKqvxGaknqWSmr9uusCynKimo2Kxpq7UrWSsp5ykerS1zaCjng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ottoman-hands-seen-emily-in-paris.html><span>←</span><span>Emily in Paris fan?

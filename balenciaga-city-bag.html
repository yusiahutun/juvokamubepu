Moss wore hers religiously, as did the Olsen twins and Nicole Richie. The City was papped on the red carpet, in classic Starbucks-run shots (a pop culture symbol of the time period) and at festivals from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/street-style/g28195829/best-glastonbury-fashion/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Glastonbury class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Glastonbury</a> to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/g39757951/coachella-fashion-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Coachella class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Coachella</a>.</p><img alt="london december 16 model kate moss takes an afternoon stroll on december 16, 2003 in west london photo by gareth cattermolegetty images" title="Kate Moss Out With Friends" width=742 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2814972-65364187343fa.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gareth Cattermole</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More recently, searches for the original Balenciaga City bag have soared, with vintage studded models now in high demand.

The Le Cagole, which debuted in 2021, features hardware that nods to the Noughties original, but with a more streamlined silhouette. Seen on the arms of everyone from Dua Lipa to Bella Hadid, it has proved every bit as popular as its predecessor.</p><img alt="balenciaga bag" title="Street Style - Berlin - December, 2022" width=689 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alice-fetisova-wears-oversized-navy-coat-black-balenciaga-news-photo-1698056102.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Vierig</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And, in April 2024, Balenciaga is re-releasing the original City bag in a new form. According to the house, numerous archival City styles have been studied and remodelled to create the new bag which perfectly mimics the original City, but with more modernised design and production.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The bag's defining characteristics (including the leather-strung zipper pulls and rivets) have subsequently inspired the aesthetic of other Balenciaga lines, including Le Cagole and Neo Classic, but Le City is created to echo the circa-2001 reference almost exactly, improved upon in terms of sustainable production."<br></p><img alt="berlin, germany january 27 lois opoku wearing fendi brown coat, red aldo overknees and balenciaga red bag on january 27, 2021 in berlin, germany photo by jeremy moellergetty images" title="Street Style - Berlin - January 27, 2021" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1299421269-1-65364034dd414.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeremy Moeller</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Inspired?

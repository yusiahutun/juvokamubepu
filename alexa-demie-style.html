The show itself is known for its <a href=#>electric fashion choices</a> and was the driving factor behind the <a href=#>revival of rhinestone eye makeup</a>. While each character has a unique trend-setting style, Maddy’s outfits are on another level.</span></p><p><span>The character simply ignores whatever the standard dress code for a situation may be and dresses for an elevated level of glamor and intrigue, even in the high school hallways. A similar analysis can be made of Alexa Demie’s personal style.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MEGA820122_004-1.jpg><p><span>Just last week, Alexa was seen leaving a pilates class with <a href=#>Hailey Bieber</a> (friendship goals) wearing a yellow silk Prada headband and loafers with her workout set. It’s hardly what you’d expect someone to wear to a workout class—and that’s what makes her so freaking cool.</span></p><p><span>Alexa’s red carpet looks have the same standout glam level. She opts for daring cut-outs, dramatic silhouettes and glittering detailing. Like her Euphoria character, Alexa’s eyes are usually heavily rimmed with dark liner and she flaunts it as her best accessory. She wears very little jewelry, but will throw on a statement earring when the gown calls for it.</span></p><p><span>Alexa is someone we can count on to take fashion risks, and that is why she will undoubtedly pioneer whatever <a href=#>fashion trends</a> come our way in 2022. In the meantime, let’s celebrate some of her best looks to date.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP20041409431876.jpg><h2>2020</h2><p>Alexa looked like a modern day Audrey Hepburn with short blunt bangs at the 2020 Vanity Fair Oscar Party.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP20042688987932.jpg><h2>2020</h2><p>This statement gown needed no accessories thanks to the see-through black embroidered lace, voluminous tulle neckline and billowing sleeves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP19316578661480.jpg><h2>2019</h2><p>Even Alexa’s business casual looks have a Euphoria feel, complete with heavy eyeliner, Prada loafers and a trendy Coperni bag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP19167262170432.jpg><h2>2019</h2><p>Alexa looks like a summer goddess in this shimmery cut-out dress, styled with barely-there sandals and chandelier earrings at the MTV Movie Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP19295092398503.jpg><h2>2019</h2><p>Leather can totally be worn as formal wear—and Alexa proved it at the 2019 InStyle Awards with this dramatic tiered gown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP19156558788000.jpg><h2>2019</h2><p>Alexa channeled her Maddy with this skin-tight snakeskin dress at the show’s season premiere in 2019. It’s the open back for me!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP18292201240997.jpg><h2>2019</h2><p>Around the time of Euphoria‘s release, Alexa’s outfits strongly resembled the looks she wore on the show. This helped the audience draw the parallel between Alexa’s personal style (like this purple number) and the trend-setting looks her character was wearing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP18281080253776.jpg><h2>2018</h2><p>Here is definitive evidence that Alexa knows what fashion items will be trending long before they show up on your TikTok FYP. She’s seen here wearing a corset top to an event way back in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AP17024016219437.jpg><h2>2017</h2><p>Alexa played into the western feel of the Sundance Film Festival back in 2017 with a suede shearling-lined coat and cowboy boots. TBH, this look still gets a 10/10 even years later.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykscuemauhpK56rbvOpKpoaWJphXeCl2iYpZ2olnqlscyinGarpK65pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robbie-williams-ayda-wear-each-others-clothes.html><span>←</span><span>Robbie Williams and wife Ayda Field pose in each other's clothes for special night in</span></a>

Not only do they increase physical activity levels, but they can strengthen their immune systems and teach them how to consider the needs of others.&nbsp;When it comes to a first pet, however,&nbsp;selecting the right one for your family&nbsp;is essential.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>There are many pros to owning a rabbit. Affectionate, quiet, and easily trained, rabbits are great for both large and small homes. But before you go giving in to their floppy ears, there are some practical things to consider.&nbsp;</p><p>So without further ado, here are the pros and cons of getting a rabbit for the kids, according to the experts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pet Rabbit Pros</h2><ul><li>“By caring for an animal, children learn to consider the needs of others,” says Animal Behaviourist&nbsp;Laura Vissaritis. “Children aged six and older are generally able to take responsibility and <a href=#>show empathy</a>, making the experience much more valuable.”</li><li>They don’t need much room — unlike other pets, rabbits are happy in their cage during the day with a little roaming-around time at night.</li><li>“Rabbits can be very affectionate&nbsp;and they are generally clean, easy to toilet train, and love to explore,” says Laura.</li><li>Some people who are allergic to cats and dogs find they’re fine (and sniffle-free) around bunnies.</li><li>They’re quieter than an elevator full of strangers; if you&nbsp;live in an apartment&nbsp;where noise is a problem, a rabbit could be the answer.</li><li>Bunnies can live indoors and can even be taught to use a litter tray (although if you plan to keep them outside, a secure enclosure is essential to protect them from predators).</li><li>Their droppings are relatively smell- and mess-free. Bonus.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pet Rabbit Cons</h2><ul><li>Some breeds grow quite large, so ask about how big the adult gets before you buy, or consider a smaller breed.</li><li>Male rabbits should be de-sexed to avoid territorial behavior (peeing on you) and females must be spayed to prevent illnesses and breeding.</li><li>They don’t get on well with other animals, so if you <a href=#>have a dog,</a> you might find serious issues.</li><li>“Rabbits have a need to chew to keep their teeth healthy,” says Laura. They’ll chew on almost anything — watch those electrical cords!</li><li>They can bite and become aggressive if when they feel cornered.</li><li>They’re more fragile than&nbsp;cats or dogs&nbsp;— children can inadvertently hurt or strangle a rabbit with rough play.</li></ul><p>This article originally appeared on our sister site, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Homes to Love</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJon6illWS9s7vSZpinnF2YvK%2B%2FjKidZp%2BVqcGqusZmmGaqkZevqsA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-campbell-lake-bell-beboe-weed-products.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Campbell and Lake Bell on Beboe Cannabis Products and New Way to Look at Smoking Weed</span></a>

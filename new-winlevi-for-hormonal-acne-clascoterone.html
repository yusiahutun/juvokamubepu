The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just approved a new cream called <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.winlevi.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Winlevi class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Winlevi</a>, and it could replace the popular off-label use of spironolactone pills. It's the first new acne medication to be approved since Accutane (isotretinoin) way back in 1982.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So how does it work, and what makes it so groundbreaking? The acne medications currently on the market rely on antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, azelaic acid, dapsone, and vitamin A derivatives known as retinoids to quell acne. Winlevi is the first to use a totally new active: 1% clascoterone. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2765025 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Clascoterone class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Clascoterone</a> is a topical androgen receptor inhibitor, meaning it inhibits testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) when applied to skin. The ingredient is also used for the treatment of hair loss on the scalp.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Androgens in your skin are responsible for the production of sebum (oil) and can lead to inflammation, which exacerbates acne. Cassiopea, the pharmaceutical company behind Winlevi, notes that while the exact mechanism behind how clascoterone works is unknown, the cream was proven to reduce acne lesions in clinical trials in both men and women over the age of 12.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What makes clascoterone such a breakthrough is that it's the first androgen blocker for acne that works in both men and women. Women are often prescribed birth control pills and spironolactone pills (off-label) to reduce androgen activity and help with acne breakouts. But as a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2765025 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2020 study in JAMA Dermatology" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2020 study in JAMA Dermatology</a> points out: "Both [birth control] and spironolactone are associated with systemic adverse effects, are contraindicated in pregnancy, and are unsuitable for use in males with acne." The study concludes that not only is clascoterone safe and effective for both men and women, but it can also be used as an adjunct treatment with other acne medications like retinoids.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“This game-changing topical drug offers a non-antibiotic approach to people with acne, by targeting the androgen receptors directly in the skin. It fills a longstanding gap in acne therapy,” notes dermatologist Michael Gold, an Investigator and Medical Director at Gold Skin Care Center and Tennessee Clinical Research Center, in the press release. “After 40 years, it provides a much-anticipated, complementary new approach to treat acne.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The clinical trials showed a reduction in acne lesions when used twice a day, and the most common side effects were reddening of the skin and dryness. “This milestone approval marks the introduction of a new class of topical medication in Dermatology," Diana Harbort, CEO of Cassiopea, notes in the press release. "Dermatologists have said targeting androgen hormonal activity in the skin is ‘the holy grail’ of acne treatment for both males and females."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Don't call your dermatologist just yet. Winlevi will be available in the U.S. starting next year.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital.

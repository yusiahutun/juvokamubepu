Previous fixtures in the international friendlies saw Ecuador draw 1-1 against Venezuela while playing at home, while Luxemburg ended in a 3-3 draw against Madagascar. In other games, world champions and winners of the World Cup, France, devastated Bolivia to a 2-0 result. There will be more international football action in the coming days as new fixtures unfold and more stars keep rejoining their national teams. We have prepared betting tips and predictions from our expert analysis of the matches based on current team form, past performances, and their head-to-head encounter history.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b15b3d3d94c2047.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>French Ligue 1 matchday 1: Betting odds, picks, correct score predictions</span></p></a><h2>International friendly games</h2><p class=align-left>Analyzing matches may seem like an overly involving task. If you are about to place your stake on different games that are lined-up in the international friendlies calendar, we have betting guides for you. It is essential to consider all the possible angles and outcome likelihoods before placing a bet and increase your winning chances. Here are the matches to look forward to:</p><h3>1. Japan vs. Trinidad & Tobago</h3><p class=align-left>Japan showed an impressive comeback in their last friendly game against Bolivia despite previously suffering major losses to the likes of Columbia and Qatar. It is evident that the Samurai Blue are not ready to down their guns ahead of their next fixture against Trinidad and Tobago in their Wednesday encounter. It is historically proven that Japan performs much better while playing at home compared to an away fixture. Further, considering that Soca Warriors have not scored in any of their three previous matches, Japan may be the favourites in this clash.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fcd9a8ec47713705.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Betting odds and predictions for Italian Serie A matchday 37</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The man to watch for this game is the sensational Shinji Kagawa given exceptional ability to outperform defence lines based on previous international soccer results. Being the first encounter between these two teams, we vouch that the game will end in favour of Japan.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction:</strong> Japan to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>2- 0</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>AFCON 2019: Harambee Stars to play Madagascar in first pre-Afcon friendly in France</p><h3>2. Brazil vs. Qatar</h3><p class=align-left>The Thursday morning clash will see Brazil step up to extend their 3-1 win over the Czech Republic in their previous fixture. The match will play in Brazil’s home turf at the Estadio Nacional de Brasilia, considered the stronghold of the home team. The Selecao have all the chances of winning this fixture especially after bouncing back from a 1-1 draw against Panama in their previous fixtures and will be aiming for all three points against the 2022 world cup hosts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a47b7907ce68b7ad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>German Bundesliga matchday 34: betting odds, picks, correct score and predictions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The South American giants will most likely stick to their usual attacking formation against Qatar. The Asian side team will equally be coming to this game high spirited after storming Japan in their last campaign but will need to reload their guns ahead of this fixture. Neymar is likely to play after an earlier injury scare and is the biggest threat for Qatar’s defence. We predict the game will end in favour of Brazil.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction</strong>: Brazil to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction</strong>: 3- 0</p><h3>3. Paraguay vs. Honduras</h3><p class=align-left>Paraguay does not seem prepared ahead of this game with their six-game winless streak, an indicator of low confidence. They have suffered back-to-back defeats against their equals such as Mexico and Peru, and Hondurans doesn’t seem like an easier fixture. On the other hand, the Los Catrachos have all the celebrations and motivation after making amends for their previous 4-1 defeat by Chile. In their head-to-head encounter, these two teams ended in a 2-2 tie and history may well repeat itself coming to this match. We predict a possible draw from this fixture as both teams seem to have the same performance strength.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d7311b1a0927fd81.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>English Premier League matchday 38: Betting odds, predictions and picks</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Draw</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction:</strong> 1 – 1</p><h3>4. Peru vs. Costa Rica</h3><p class=align-left>The Thursday football game will see Estadio Monumental stadium as the host to the clash between Peru and Costa Rica. In their last fixture, Peru was devastated to a 2-0 loss and will be coming to this match with a high desire of making amends for their previous loss. However, beating Costa Rica is just another nightmare on their plates. With Manuel Rodrigues in the lineup, maybe Peru will have a reason to smile after all.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Costa Rica will be seeking to build up their 1-0 victory over Jamaica. Therefore, they will uphold their defence approach while maintaining the counter-attacking style of play through their superb striker and perfect finisher Joel Campbell. Both teams will be mostly defensive that offensive ahead of this game and we predict a potential draw.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction:</strong> Draw</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction:</strong> 1 – 1</p><h3>5. The United States vs. Jamaica</h3><p class=align-left>Following an impressive run that saw them win a three-piece against the likes of Ecuador and Costa Rica followed by a 1-1 draw against Chile, the USA are at their best form so far. Gregg Berhalter, the USA coach, is optimistic that his side will put the best fight against the Jamaicans even as they prepare for the CONCACAF Gold Cup 2019. The 29-year-old Jozy Altidore will be the man to watch and will most likely be a big headache for the Jamaican defence.</p><p class=align-left>The Reggae Boyz, on the other hand, are coming to this match with the hope of overturning the 1-0 loss suffered against Costa Rica in their last friendly fixture. Their Thursday game is just another uphill task awaiting them. Thus we predict a win in favour of the Yanks.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>USA to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction:</strong> 2 – 0</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b15b3d3d94c2047.jpg><h3>6. Mexico vs. Venezuela</h3><p class=align-left>The Mercedes Benz stadium will be the host of the clash between Mexico and Venezuela. Mexico is the favourites as they seek to build up the back-to-back wins they have had over the likes of Chile and Paraguay. El Tri has pulled out the best performances, scoring goals after goals in all their matches and will not stop in their next fixture against Venezuela.</p><p class=align-left>Carlos Vela may be the man to watch given the impressive season he has had at the MLS but is uncertain about playing for the national team. On the other hand, the La Vinotinto played to a 1-1 draw against their arch-rivals Ecuador in their last fixture and may be seeking to upgrade their attack in the fixture against Mexico. However, the Thursday game doesn’t seem to be a walk in the park for the Venezuelans but may manage to score a few goals.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Mexico to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction</strong>: 3 – 2</p><h3>7. Fiji vs. Tahiti</h3><p class=align-left>Fiji has won twice, drew one and lost one of their last four matches. They have scored in each of the four appearances and won their previous game against Mauritius in a fixture that ended 1-0. They are undisputedly the better team whenever they play at home. As they welcome Tahiti, it’s all systems go as they seek to extend their two-match unbeaten streak at home. Tahiti, on the other hand, lost their last match against Papua New Guinea in a home fixture and have cumulatively lost twice in their previous six games. The two sides are goal scoring machines, but this fixture is more likely to end in favour of Fiji.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Fiji to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>2 – 1</p><h3>8. Chile vs. Haiti</h3><p class=align-left>After a split point match against the United States in their previous game held at the BBVA Compass Stadium, Chile has nothing else in mind other than returning to their winning ways. Going into this game will see the inclusion of Chile’s stars such as Arturo Vidal, and Alexis Sanchez who will be a major challenge for the Haitians.</p><p class=align-left>Charles Araguiz, the Bayer Leverkusen midfielder, is poised to start the match for the home team as well. On the other hand, Haiti may well be coming to this game a bit determined but not as competitive. Marc Collat’s men have suffered defeat in all their three previous fixtures and may not be any close to winning this match. We foresee a win in favour of Chile at the Estadio La Portada de la Serena come Friday.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Chile to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>3 – 0</p><h3>9. Bermuda v.s Guyana</h3><p class=align-left>Bermuda has won two of their last three fixtures with one away against the Dominican Republic and another at home against El Salvador. They are currently in preparation for CONCACAF Gold Cup where they will play Haiti, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. As a result, they will need a win in their warm-up matches both as motivation and to sharpen their skills. Guyana has also had two wins in three games and will be starting against the USA in the CONCACAF Gold Cup. Success for both teams will be pivotal ahead of their next assignments. From our analysis, the two teams have equal motivation ahead of this game, but will most probably end in favour of Bermuda, given their excellent home performance record.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Bermuda to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction</strong>: 3 – 2</p><h3>10. South Korea vs. Australia</h3><p class=align-left>The Korea Republic will once again be on the pitch to prove their worth as they host Australia in their next international friendly fixture. The home team have so far outmatched the likes of Columbia and Bolivia, but a more challenging game awaits them come Friday. The Socceroos will be matching into this game to make amends after a poor show in the 2019 Asian cup.</p><p class=align-left>The most significant advantage for the visitors is the fact that Son will be on rest after the Champions League appearance for Spurs. South Korea, for a long time, has been depending on the efforts of Son and his absence may well be a devastating reality. For this reason, we think that the Socceroos will be a stronger and better side as they visit Korea at home. In their last meeting, the two teams walked away with a point each after a 1-1 draw.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction:</strong> Australia to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>1 – 2</p><h3>11. Tunisia vs. Iraq</h3><p class=align-left>What an encounter to await between Tunisia and Iraq come Friday. In their last battle, the two teams ended in a 2-1 score in favour of Tunisia, and Iraq will be surely seeking revenge. The Eagle Soft Carthage lost in their game against North African side Algeria in the 2019 warm-up matches and won’t be taking any chances this time around. On the other hand, the Asood Al-Rafidain are equally equipped ahead of this fixture.</p><p class=align-left>They have already outplayed their previous competitors in a series of back-to-back wins against both Jordan and Syria. However, they have also proved to be struggling in most of their away matches and may well reflect in this fixture. Youssef Msakni will be the man to watch in this match given his 9-goal contribution to the national team so far. We think that all factors held constant, Tunisia will triumph.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Tunisia to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>2 – 1</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fcd9a8ec47713705.jpg><h3>12. Chinese Taipei vs. Nepal</h3><p class=align-left>Chinese Taipei lost their last fixture against the Solomon Islands and will be coming to this match with all guns to amend their loss. They have also lost three of their last five fixtures and drawn once against Myanmar in a fixture that ended 0-0 fulltime. Nepal, on the other hand, is also coming to make amends after a devastating losing streak with the latest 2-0 defeat by Malaysia. Both teams have challenges to deal with given their poor team form. We, therefore, predict a possible draw in this match as none of the teams seems better than the other.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Draw</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction:</strong> 0 – 0</p><h3>13. Kenya vs. Madagascar</h3><p class=align-left>Kenya’s Harambee stars have lost only one of their last five matches and had one cancellation against Sierra Leone. They devastated their neighbours Ethiopia to a 3-0 win at home just a month after defeating Continent giants, Ghana. Harambee Stars squad under Sebastian Migne will be seeking to extend their impressive performance and raise their hopes ahead of the AFCON Tourney in Egypt. Madagascar, on the other hand, is not an easy side that can be undermined. Despite not qualifying for the AFCON 2019, they are known for their ease of scoring goals in every competition and may prove that in this fixture. However, we believe that Harambee stars are better motivated and have a bigger picture at stake that will steer them to a win.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Kenya to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction:</strong> 2 – 1</p><h3>14. Ivory Coast vs. Comoros</h3><p class=align-left>Ivory Coast has two remaining international friendlies before the AFCON competitions in Egypt. In their last friendly fixture, they outplayed Liberia and emerged with a 1-0 victory. Coming to this fixture, they will be seeking to extend their good performances over the years. Furthermore, they will be having all their squad intact and ready to edge out Comoros. On the other hand, Comoros displayed a great performance in the COSAFA Cup, edging out both Zimbabwe and Mauritius in the semi and quarter-finals respectively. Their 2019 lineup is composed of youngsters and top of the form squad to reckon with. However, given Ivory Coast’s experience and performance record, they will outperform Comoros in a tightly contested match.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction:</strong> Ivory Coast to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction:</strong> 2 – 1</p><h3>15. Uruguay vs. Panama</h3><p class=align-left>Uruguay is the winner of the China Cup after edging out Thailand to a 4-0 win. Other than the 2-0 loss to France at the World Cup quarter-finals, they have not lost any other fixture and will be seeking to extend their impressive winning streak. It is expected the Suarez will be there, making the situation even worse for the visitors. Panama, on the other hand, has been on a poor performance streak since their 1-2 loss to Tunisia at the World Cup.</p><p class=align-left>They also lost 3-0 to the USA and 3-0 Columbia. Coming to this match, they will be on the receiving end of Uruguay’s attacking formation. Their only hope and motivation come from the 1-1 draw they managed to pull against Brazil in their previous fixture. We think that Uruguay is better equipped and motivated coming to this match compared to their visitors.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Uruguay to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>2 – 0</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>AFCON 2019: Kashiwa finally release Michael Olunga as forward links up with Harambee Stars</p><h3>16. Argentina vs. Nicaragua</h3><p class=align-left>Argentina has won only two of their last four matches losing twice to Venezuela and France. Their previous friendly against African side Morocco ended in a 1-0 win to their advantage and will be likely to extend their success to two consecutive games this weekend. They will play hosts to Nicaragua who has had an impressive performance so far. In their last five fixtures, they have won thrice, lost twice and emerged with one draw against Bolivia.</p><p class=align-left>As they prepare for the CONCACAF Gold Cup, this match will be a great eye-opener and pacesetter for them. Therefore, they will be seeking to win and extend their total wins in the last six games to four. We believe that both teams have a good chance of walking away with the three points. Argentina is more likely, given their superb striking lineup comprising of Messi and Aguero as well as Dybala and Di Maria.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Argentina to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction:</strong> 3 – 1</p><h3>17. Nigeria vs. Zimbabwe</h3><p class=align-left>Nigeria is the West African king and among the best teams in the continent. They have already qualified for the AFCON Cup and will be a potential contender of the final prize against other best teams in the continent. In their previous fixture, they edged out Seychelles in the group stage of the AFCON Cup winning 3-0. A subsequent friendly fixture against Egypt saw them walk away with another win after a 1-0 score.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Zimbabwe has won their last two fixtures against Congo and Comoros and have qualified for the continental showpiece. They are still in the COSAFA Cup semi-final and will be playing against their neighbours Zambia. Given the importance of the COSAFA Cup to the country, we foresee reduced energy as they play this friendly against Nigeria.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Nigeria to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction</strong>: 2 – 0</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a47b7907ce68b7ad.jpg><h3>18. Singapore vs. Solomon Islands</h3><p class=align-left>Singapore is currently playing in the AFF Championship. So far, they have managed to outperform two of their past opponents and lost twice in other matches. Coming to this match, they were just devastated to a 3-0 loss to Thailand and will be seeking to amend their failure. On the other hand, Solomon Islands have won two of their last three matches and scored in all. Since losing to New Zealand in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers on goal aggregate, they have come back stronger and rejuvenated edging Vanuatu and Chinese Taipei to a 3-1 and 0-1 scores respectively. We think that they will extend their winning streak in this match.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Solomon Islands to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction:</strong> 1 – 2</p><h3>19. Cameroon vs. Zambia</h3><p class=align-left>Cameroon is in the AFCON Cup thanks to their 3-0 win over Comoros on March 23, 2019. Nothing seems to stop them as all their international stars are back in the starting lineup including Andre-Frank and Jerome Onguene. On the other hand, Zambia is in the COSAFA Cup semi-final against Zimbabwe and will be concentrating all their energy and resources towards winning this match. Therefore, we don’t think they will have what it takes to win against Cameroon in the friendlies.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Cameroon to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction</strong>: 2 – 0</p><h3>20. Brazil vs. Honduras</h3><p class=align-left>Brazil will be the hosts to Honduras come Sunday. The international friendly match will play at the home turf of the Samba Boys. Brazil seems like predetermined favourites in the game, given the return of their international stars such as Neymar, Gabriel Jesus, and Fernandino among others. Hondurans, on the other hand, won their last match in the World Cup qualifiers against Mexico in 2017 and have not had any other win since then. They will be no match to the fire breathing Samba Boys who want to reclaim their position as South America’s soccer kings.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Brazil to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction</strong>: 3 – 0</p><h3>21. Japan vs. El Salvador</h3><p class=align-left>After reclaiming themselves from two consecutive losses to Qatar and Columbia in a 1-0 win against Bolivia, Japan has another chance to prove their worth. This time around, they will be welcoming El Salvador in their home turf. El Salvador has won all three past fixtures they have played and will be seeking to extend their winning streak come Sunday. However, facing Japan is a different competition compared to the likes of Jamaica and Haiti they have outperformed before. We feel that this match will be a tight tie, but Japan with the help of Shinji Kagawa will most likely emerge with a win.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Japan to win</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction:</strong> 1 – 0</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Jose Mourinho names 6 Liverpool players in his Champions League team of the season</p><h3>22. USA vs. Venezuela</h3><p class=align-left>The United States has won all three of their last four matches and drew once against Chile. This match will be the icebreaker before their CONCACAF Cup group stage matches where they will play Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Panama. They will be seeking a win that will motivate ahead of the competition. Venezuela has not lost in their last five fixtures and will be readier than their opponents going into this match. They will be warming up for the Copa America group stage matches where they will play against Peru, Brazil, and Bolivia. The two sides have a close tie in their performances and their abilities going forward, hence our split point prediction.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction: </strong>Draw</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>1 – 1</p><p class=align-left>Our international friendly odds are based on the head-to-head performance of the teams, their history, and their current form.

 They have a large castle, numerous outbuildings and 1,200 acres that they could build on.
However, the millionaire Dent-Brocklehurst family are planning to put up a new barn only a few yards from someone else's home, leading to accusations that they are being 'unneighbourly'."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire</p><p><span>The barn will stand opposite a large £1million house which currently enjoys spectacular panoramic Cotswolds views.</span></p><p><span>The scheme is said to have been grudgingly approved by Tewkesbury Borough Council planning committee because there were no legal grounds to refuse it.</span></p><p><span>However some have questioned why the barn had to be so close – about 40 feet – to a nearby home.</span></p><p><span>The Sudeley Castle estate, owned by Henry Dent-Brocklehurst, his sister Mollie and their American mother Lady Ashcombe, says the new building would be used to store agricultural equipment.</span></p><p><span>Tory councillor Rob Vines said he felt the neighbour was getting 'a raw deal over the matter from a visual point of view'.</span></p><p><span>He added: 'There was an unco-operative and unneighbourly aspect to this application, though we can't refuse it in planning terms.'</span></p><p><span>Fellow Tory councillor Ron Allen wondered why the castle could not set up the barn elsewhere because it had plenty of land on which to do so.</span></p><p><span>Committee chairman John Evetts said they could suggest that the barn be put elsewhere but could not insist on it.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/12/30/article-2080412-0002D6C500000258-952_634x428.jpg height=428

estate suffered a downturn in business which saw annual losses of £100,000.<br></span></p><p><span>To rectify the situation, the family applied to convert a barn and cow stalls into residential accommodation so they could move out of the castle, although it is not known if the plan was carried out.</span></p><p><span>Lady Ashcombe inherited the estate when her first husband, Mark Dent-Brocklehurst, the stockbroker father of Henry and Mollie, died aged 40 in 1972.</span></p><p><span>Sudeley is ten miles from the village of Cowley, where a row has erupted over a partially built

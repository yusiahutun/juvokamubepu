They eventually tied the knot on November 2, 1943, and welcomed two sons, Michael (born in 1944) and Joel Douglas (born in 1947).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/3dd633473912-michael-douglas-mom-diana-golden-globes.jpg><p id=elg4r63V_It data-wc=46>Despite Diana and Kirk's decision to divorce in 1951, the two remained on friendly terms, and they even appeared alongside one another in several movies, including The Indian Fighter (1955) and It Runs in the Family (2003), which also starred their son Michael, and grandson Cameron.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/da95e4dd3f18-it-runs-in-the-family-michael-douglas-mom-diana.jpg><p id=e3l5LqQ-tZ0 data-wc=60>According to Michael – who was seven at the time of his parent's divorce – their separation never bothered him. "I was raised with my brother Joel by our mother on the east coast, visiting my father in Los Angeles during holidays," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian</a> in 2010.

"She just taught me more about giving it your best shot. She's English and Bermudian, so they have kind of this stiff upper lip and can carry on."</p><p id=eF2y_y_MI1i data-wc=37>While chatting to Variety, Michael added that Diana had a "wicked sense of humor, very bright" and at the same event told Associated Press: "My mother had an incredible sense of dignity and was a class act."&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas' Love Story</figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcG9sZm18rrXCoZiepF2ZvLazy5qqZqunmrK1ecGopZ1llpa6sMHSZqSorJiav26wyJqlmmWUpMKouMCsZKudppqurbHDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./macy-jenkins.html><span>←</span><span>Macy Jenkins Biography</span></a>

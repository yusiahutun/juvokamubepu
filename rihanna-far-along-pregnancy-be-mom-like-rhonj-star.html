Just love the way that she just allows her kids to be who they are. And that's really inspiring to me," the Fenty Beauty founder told Elle. "But Teresa [Giudice] from Jersey does not play about her kids."</p><p>"She will flatten you about those kids," she continued. "And that resonates with me a lot because I feel like that's the type of mom I'm going to be. Psycho about it."</p><p>When Elle brought up Teresa's infamous table flip, Riri joked that she'll be "worse," saying, "You talk about my kids, it's over."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The Grammy winner went on to share the "best advice" she's received about motherhood so far, saying she's been told to "sleep now because I won't get much later. I need to work on that before it's a thing of the past."</p><p>Meanwhile, Riri also spoke about her "glow," sharing whether or not it's Fenty Beauty, her pregnancy glow, or both.</p><p>"I mean, they go hand in hand. There's a pregnancy glow," she explained. "There's also those days, girl. Especially in the third trimester where you wake up and you're like, oh, do I have to get dressed? Makeup for sure helps you feel like a real person. I just focused a lot on moisturizing and on contouring. The face gets a little round and chubby. The nose starts to spread."</p><p>"Everything is a challenge, from getting dressed and how you're going to do your makeup," she added, sharing that she enjoys challenges. "I like things that force me to be creative and create in new ways. And with beauty, there's so much that you can do."</p><p>Rihanna and A$AP, 33, <a href=#>announced to the world</a> on January 31 that they're expecting their first child together. The couple -- who have reportedly been dating since 2020 -- revealed the news by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posing for photos together</a> in which Riri's growing baby bump was front and center -- bare for the world to see.</p><p>"When I first found out, it's not real, you know? I was like, 'This is not for real, right?' And then, it was and it's almost like you don't want to get too excited too soon because it's great news, but you...want to see that it's going to see its way through. And I'm so glad that we're this far along and now I can celebrate with everyone," Rihanna told <a href=#>E! News</a> last month.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><a id=gallery-link-fc2ce79c-1607-455a-9fb1-2be2d97417af class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:fc2ce79c-1607-455a-9fb1-2be2d97417af data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:b8e1bb03-d0e6-4059-9860-ddaa1f76e6f3 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2f/4by3/2022/02/25/2fb4e43acd5b47d6a160e2f8bc724203_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2xmam5fp7aprc2nmGaekad6orjOp55mqKKatK%2BtzZywZpqVYrqwuYyloKSdXae1sLrJZqqtmaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./parents-seaside-locale-troubled-six-year-old-son-realty-mom-beat-infant-sister-death-tell-sucker-punched-one-neighbor-stole-s-car-keys-tried-drive-away-html.html><span>←</span><span>Neighbors to boy who beat baby sister to death tell how he was 'terror of the town'</span></a>

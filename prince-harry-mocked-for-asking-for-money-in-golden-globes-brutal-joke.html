They were in the spotlight after comedian host Jo Koy referenced the Sussexes in his opening monologue.</strong></p><p>The host of the <a href=#>Golden Globes</a>, Jo Koy, took aim at Prince Harry with his funny speech at the beginning of the event. Even though the Sussexes didn’t attend the glitzy and glam <a href=#>awards show</a>, they both still managed to be referenced in some way throughout the night. When it comes to <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>, it was his connections with The Firm that led to him being at the center of a joke during the opening sequence.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-roasted-at-the-golden-globes>Prince Harry roasted at the Golden Globes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1199878127-1024x683.jpg><p>Jo Koy, who also took a swipe at Robert De Niro in his monologue, started discussing The Crown. He applauded the <a href=#>TV</a> series, which saw its final episode air last year. Koy spoke fondly of celebrity actress Imelda Staunton who played the <a href=#>Queen</a> in the Netflix series.</p><p>He told the Golden Globes crowd her <a href=#>royal</a> performance was second to none – before taking a swipe at Prince Harry.</p><p>Koy said: “How great was Imelda Staunton in The Crown, wasn’t she amazing? Her portrayal of the Queen was so good, Prince Harry called her and asked her for money.”</p><p>The host claimed he didn’t ‘write all his jokes’ because he only ‘got’ the gig 10 days before.</p><p>He quipped: “Like I said, I didn’t write all of these! That one wasn’t mine!</p><p>“Prince Harry and Meghan will still be paid millions of dollars for doing absolutely nothing – and that’s just by Netflix!”</p><p>Koy is referencing the <a href=#>Netflix</a> docu-series, titled, Harry & Meghan, which released in December 2022, 13 months ago. The deal is said to be worth $100m, which will see the royals collaborate on multiple projects with the streaming giant.</p><p>So far, fans have seen their documentary as well as the Duke’s separate series on the Invictus Games.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-are-divided-over-the-joke>Fans are divided over the joke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1908168838-1024x683.jpg><p>One fan claimed: “It’s official. Harry and Meghan are the laughingstock of <a href=#>Hollywood</a>.”</p><p>A second added: “Seriously, guys, there is NO coming back from this! The entire room laughed at them!”</p><p>When a third wrote: “Ya that was really embarrassing! I feel for her, even though you know.”</p><p>“That’s priceless. Definitely be collapsed on the floor sobbing,” another added.</p><p>But not all viewers agreed. Someone else wrote: “These jokes totally bombed. Just not funny.”</p><p>And another pointed out: “There was not a lot of laughter.”</p><p>One critic penned: “Let’s just HOPE he didn’t waste this paycheck because he’s never working again.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-s-was-also-caught-up-in-the-action>Meghan Markle’s was also caught up in the action</h2><p>It comes as <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> was also apparently snubbed at the celebrity event.</p><p>Her former Suits co-stars reunited on the stage to hand out an award, but her absence was clear for all to see at home.</p><p>When her ex-colleague, Gina Torres, was asked who invited the <a href=#>Duchess for the special meet up</a>, it came out that no one did.</p><p>Gina told the interviewer: “We don’t have her number. We just don’t, so… She’ll see, she’ll watch. She’ll be happy that we’re here.”</p><p>It’s hard to imagine no one had her number. Meghan better reach out.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WFcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GakqJubmrFuss6rZJqrm567qHnFqKlmpZ%2Bjsrp5yKdkoKecmbKvecalppudo2Kvs8HTmqNmop%2BgsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./parris-bell-bio-family-marriage-husband-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Parris Bell Bio, Family, Marriage, Husband, and Net Worth</span></a>

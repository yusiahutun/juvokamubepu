Southeast Asian shoppers are also big buyers of Lego in Hong Kong as prices are generally lower.</p><p class="print-article__body article-details-type--p content--p" data-v-88e2b9ac data-v-a800b79e>The expansion comes after the company, founded in the 1930s as a maker of wooden toys, said in September that it would overhaul its entire organisation and cut 1,400 jobs after a fall in revenues in the first half of 2017, which was the first drop in revenues for the company in a decade.</p><p class="print-article__body article-details-type--p content--p" data-v-88e2b9ac data-v-a800b79e>The company blamed the declines on weak sales in Europe and the US markets, saying it was because of poor product development and marketing in those regions. The company did not give figures for Hong Kong, but said revenue in China grew by double digits in the first half.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/01/05/ad426362-f205-11e7-bd43-e13d2822bb61_1320x770_205928.JPG alt="The world's largest Lego ship model, on display at Hong Kong’s Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.

In fact Lego investing is big business globally: there is a website in the US, brickpicker.com, which comes with a price calculator to indicate how much a particular set may be worth, while Australian comparison site finder.com.au found in research published last March that some vintage Lego sets could produce returns of over 1,000 per cent.</p><p class="print-article__body article-details-type--p content--p" data-v-88e2b9ac data-v-a800b79e>“Hong Kong people like trendy things, and Lego is one of them,” Tsang said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvbO1za1mm62jnrumv9JomKusmZi5pnuRamlwaGNqfKO%2ByJyirGWRo7Fuuc6rq5qqXZ2yrbyMppiknV2aw6a%2B2K2foqaXYq64sdKopJ5lnJq0sHnHqKWgZZuku6g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billy-gardell-update-150-pound-weight-loss.html><span>←</span><span>Billy Gardell Gives Update on His 150-Pound Weight Loss</span></a>

One person wrote: "#HeartOfStone neither has the heart nor has any stones lending any gravity. <strong>It's just a rehash of multiple action movies we have seen before many times</strong>. #GalGadot in autopilot mode, #AliaBhatt was good in a limited role, she deserved better and so did we."</p><p id=eugvb7f4J9J data-wc=41>A second person penned: "No disrespect to the actors or writers but this film is beyond far-fetched, it should have been a comedy. #HeartOfStone," while another added: "#HeartOfStone is a disappointment.

It's a one-woman show!" while another even suggested she be cast as the next James Bond, penning: "I'm halfway through #HeartofStone and <strong>I'm already convinced that @GalGadot should be the next James Bond</strong>.

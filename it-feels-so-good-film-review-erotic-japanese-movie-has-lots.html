“Who do you want to be with at the end of the world?” is the question posed to the young lovers in Haruhiko Arai’s erotic drama It Feels So Good, which was somehow named best film of 2019 by prestigious critical journal Kinema Junpo.
The film stars Kumi Takiuchi, who was named best actress by the same publication, as a young woman who embarks on a torrid affair with an old flame in the days before her marriage to a high-ranking military man."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

All the while, looming on the periphery is an impending natural disaster more threatening even than Naoko’s wedding.</p>Erotic “<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">roman porno</span></a>” films have long had a significant place in Japanese cinema. As early as the 1960s, directors like Koji Wakamatsu larded their exploitation films, full of nudity and violence, with social and political subtext.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arai cut his teeth scripting films for Wakamatsu before embarking on his own prolific screenwriting career, which includes such gems as Rape Ceremony and Captured Mother and Daughter: She Beast. More recently, Arai adapted Mari Akasaka’s novel Vibrator, and wrote Kabukicho Love Hotel, both for director Ryuichi Hiroki.Ironically, It Feels So Good cannot even fulfil the overtly suggestive promise of its title, let alone spark any legitimate philosophical debate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/20/3e7c0942-98c5-11ea-96ff-7aff439fc3be_972x_123931.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Arai and his performers fail spectacularly to conjure anything remotely arousing during the numerous, lengthy sex scenes. Takiuchi and Emoto have no discernible on-screen chemistry, while the coital choreography is dull, unrealistic, and repetitive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Takiuchi has proved, in films such as Eiji Uchida’s Greatful Dead and Hiroki’s Side Job, that she is an engaging screen presence, capable of so much more than simply disrobing for the camera. Opposite Emoto, who exudes all the charisma of a bucket of fish heads, she is left to drown in pseudointellectual gibberish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Watching It Feels So Good does not just feel less good than Arai might have intended; with a running time of 115 minutes it becomes an interminable chore.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The 25 best Japanese movies of the 21st century</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The apocalyptic navel-gazing of its finale is a desperate last-ditch attempt to evoke the superior talents of Arai’s former collaborators, but serves only to expose the yawning chasm that separates them.</p>Want more articles like this?

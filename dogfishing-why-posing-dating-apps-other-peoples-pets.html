<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Dogfishing: why posing on dating apps with other peoples pets wont help you find love</h1></header><section class=post-content><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On Tinder, Avery Chuang developed a bad habit: she almost always swiped right on guys with a ridiculously adorable dog photo. It’s not a high standard to go by, the 25-year-old Californian admitted, but it helped her find men who are dog owners like herself – presuming that, of course, the featured pup is theirs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She encountered her fair share of dog-baiters on dating apps (which she no longer uses since they are “addictive and demoralising”). Most men were upfront in conversation with Chuang, but a few did slip through the cracks until she pieced it together.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There was a guy Chuang found attractive and charming and normal – until he turned around and questioned her for probing about his dog. And there was another who profusely apologised for displaying a friendly corgi that wasn’t his (after she called him out) and then ghosted her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dogs, notably adorable photos of dogs, are a ubiquitous aspect of dating. They’re convenient icebreakers on apps and on first dates. They add a nugget of personality to a profile. On Apple’s App Store, Bumble features a photo of a bespectacled man cuddling a Goldendoodle dog to insinuate how likeable that is. There’s also Dig, a new dating app specifically for dog owners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/13/ca3862ec-bd6e-11e9-8f25-9b5536624008_1320x770_163901.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This cultural obsession with dogs on the apps has spiralled into another problem: daters are posting photos of pups they do not own, to attract matches. “Dogfishing” is not exactly a lie – the person did take a photo with that dog – but to some daters, it feels like a veiled form of deception. And things can get awkward fast when a date realises that the pet in the profile solely exists as bait.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s the main thing: stop borrowing dogs,” says Erika Ettin, an online dating coach in Washington. She advises her clients to curate profiles representative of their actual life. “It’s just odd when you’re using someone else’s dog online, and it seems like you’re trying too hard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/13/ccfb10ba-bd6e-11e9-8f25-9b5536624008_972x_163901.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She thinks people are faking dog ownership because it suggests that a person has nurturing qualities, especially men: a 2014 survey of Match.com users showed that on the site, more women sought out men who have dogs than the other way around.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Sometimes women subconsciously equate things like how a man treats his dog [with] how he would treat a partner,” Ettin says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whenever Gaby Wolff, of Ann Arbor, in the US state of Michigan, swipes and sees a dog photo, she cringes at the memory of one of her most awkward dates. Sam had a promising profile. They had good banter over drinks, and at the end of the night, she was comfortable enough to suggest a dog-walking date for next time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The energy of the conversation changed completely, and it took me by surprise,” the 30-year-old says. Sensing her date’s hesitation, Wolff changed the topic, but the rest of the night could not be redeemed. Sam later apologised for his behaviour in a post-date text, admitting that he did not know how to explain that he did not own the Labrador on his Hinge profile.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/13/cc53c274-bd6e-11e9-8f25-9b5536624008_1320x770_163901.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He said something along the lines of: it would’ve been too awkward to bring up,” she says. Wolff took one final profile scroll through Sam’s profile before unmatching him, and noticed that it changed: the photo of him walking a large black lab was gone, replaced with a generic photo at a bar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dogfishing also requires an accomplice – the dog owner. Johnny Nguyen loves to dote on his girls – Lucy, a golden retriever, and Lulu, a Pomeranian. He is aware that they help facilitate interactions with women, but now the 21-year-old in Sydney, Australia, has a girlfriend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, his male friends have leapt at the chance to borrow Lucy (the friendlier dog) for their own dating purposes. “They would come over with a girl, introduce her to the dog and go to the park together,” he says. This happens a few times a year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/13/cd8c2ea6-bd6e-11e9-8f25-9b5536624008_972x_163901.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It does not bother Nguyen, but he is occasionally baffled when, on occasion, his friends do not bring the girl to Nguyen’s flat and instead act like Lucy is theirs. For the most part, he thinks women could not care less who the dog’s owner is after a memorably fun date. That’s the tough part – getting a date in the first place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiucilsGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaCofKK%2B06KapZ1faH1zfpRub2icn5yzqr%2FHoqWgZaedxm68zqygp59dma61tc2gZJqooKh6sMDHnqlmqJWkva2x0mannqyj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrew-scott-has-a-message-for-those-still-watching-fleabag-says-do-something-better-with-your-life-1293318.html><span>←</span><span>Andrew Scott Has A Message For Those Still Watching Fleabag, Says, Do Something Better With Your</span></a>

So, you go to college, you get to stay on the payroll," said Don, who has five children, including Dakota, 31, from his marriage to <a href=#>Melanie Griffith</a>.</p><p>"Toward the end of high school, I went to [Dakota] and I said, 'So, do you want to go visit some colleges?' Or something like that," he recalled. "And she was like, 'Oh, no. I'm not going to college.'"</p><p>"I went, 'OK, you know what that means? You won't be on the payroll anymore,'" Don continued, adding that he asked Dakota how she was "going to manage."</p><p>The "Kenan" star said his daughter told him: "Don't you worry about it."</p><p>Although Don pressed for more info, Dakota didn't share any details at the time. However, three weeks later, she was cast in <a href=#>David Fincher's</a> award-winning film, "The Social Network."</p><p>"And the rest is, shall we say, cinema history," Don said.</p><p>"She doesn't really call me for advice," he added of Dakota. "She calls me to say, 'Gosh, I would see you, but I've got three pictures that I'm shooting at the same time.'"</p><p>In addition to Dakota, Don is also father to Jesse, 38, from his relationship with Patti D'Arbanville and shares three children with wife Kelley Phleger: Grace, 21, Jasper, 18, and Deacon, 14.</p><a id=gallery-link-23f29adb-7a30-44e6-a7e0-60b8a7a553c9 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:23f29adb-7a30-44e6-a7e0-60b8a7a553c9 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:3f39b341-fd49-4758-b701-13cf25c3a959 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/4by3/2021/03/08/e62111ae26454e07b14078f33eea2c2d_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2xmamlfmbyvecmon6ern6N6psTPpZiipqNixKnFjKGcZpulqXqlrdSgn62domKxorfOrZhmp5abeqe1zZqlnKGRobm6ecCsZJplpJqyr3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./veteran-manager-seymour-heller-dies.html><span>←</span><span>Veteran Manager Seymour Heller Dies</span></a>

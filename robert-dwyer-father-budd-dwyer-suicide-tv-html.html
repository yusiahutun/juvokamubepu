He claimed that Torquato Jr, who came from a Democratic family, used him to reach out to the Republicans and convince them to secure the bid for him. Torquato Jr spent 4 years in prison.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the documentary, Smith also claimed that his client threatened his family if he went to the grand jury and gave his testimony. While on the stand for Dwyer’s trial, Smith confessed that he lied about whether he had actually offered the politicians the bribe or not.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He would then explain that the reasoning behind lying had to do with the lies Torquato told while on the stand because he was trying to ensure a plea bargain.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the film, Smith said: ‘Torquato told me, he said “if you do that, if you go to the Grand Jury tomorrow, when you come home, you’ll find Moose (Smith’s son Will’s nickname) floating face down in the swimming pool.”’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the revelation, Dwyer and his team grew even more suspicious of what was happening.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While Smith’s credibility as a witness was now in question, the defence felt that they did not need to get on the stand as they would surely confuse the jury.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to his lawyer, Paul Killion, Dwyer was quick to turn down his own plea bargain. Acting U.S. Attorney Jim West offered to let the politician plead guilty to only one count if he were to resign from office. At most he would have served a five-year-term but would be financially ruined and would have to admit wrongdoing. Dwyer continued to insist he was innocent.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Throughout the trial and to the press, Dwyer maintained his innocence but on December 18, 1986, he was found guilty of racketeering, bribery, fraud and conspiracy by a jury that deliberated for 20 hours over the course of four days.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is believed that Judge Malcolm Muir wanted to make an example out of Dwyer because of his high profile and had threatened him with a 55 year sentence. Asher, who was co-accused along with Dwyer, only received a year in prison after he resigned from office. Upon release, he got back involved with politics eventually becoming Pennsylvania's Republican National Committeeman.</p><h3>more videos</h3><a class=js-move-prev href=#

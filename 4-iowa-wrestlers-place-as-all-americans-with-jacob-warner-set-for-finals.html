I couldn’t imagine being anywhere else on the planet. Iowa is the place to be. Tom and Terry would do anything for me. It's awesome." <a href=#>#NCAAWrestling</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wCbUUkv04Y</a></p>— Hawkeye Headquarters (@HawkeyeHQ) <a href=#>March 19, 2022</a></figure><p>“Wrestling at Iowa has changed my life in the best way possible,” DeSanto said. “I couldn’t imagine being anywhere else on the planet. Iowa is the place to be. Tom and Terry would do anything for me. They have made me a better person. Not just in wrestling but in life.”</p><p>Kemerer split a pair of matches to place fourth and finished the tournament with his fifth All-America honor. He is the only wrestler in program history with five All-America honors. His 6-4 win in the consolation semis was the 100th of his career. He fell to fourth place following a 12-4 loss in the consolation finals.</p><p>“I’m a competitor and I hate losing, and it’s tough to put that aside but at the same time the other voice inside me is trying to tell me how much I have to be thankful for and how good my college career has been,” Kemerer said. “All of the good things I’d tell someone else I am trying to tell myself. It’s a little battle there.”</p><p>Marinelli won by medical forfeit in the fifth-place match. He finished his career a four-time Big Ten Conference champion and four-time All-American.</p><p>“My goal and my word that I like to describe myself is a champion,” Marinelli said. “If I don’t get what I want I can still be a champion off the mat. I can still be a champion the way I carry myself. I will be a champion for Christ. I will be a champion for my wife, my teammates, my friends, my family. In the future I’d love to coach. I’d love to lead someone to a victory, and I’ll be a champion for them.”</p><p>Cassioppi finished his tournament a three-time All-American with a 2-0 win in the seventh-place match. He won his final match with a second-period rideout and third-period escape.</p><p>“I didn’t necessarily have the results I had last year,” Cassioppi said. “I took third last year and seventh this year, but I am a lot better wrestler than I was last year. I have improved a lot and I need to keep that going on the mat. I need to keep movement on the mat.”</p><p>The Hawkeyes enter Saturday night with third place secured in the team standings. Penn State leads the team race with 111.5 points. Michigan is in second with 91 points.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UP NEXT</strong></p><p>The NCAA finals begin Saturday at 6 p.m. (CT).

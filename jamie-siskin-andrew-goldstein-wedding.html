Yes, even a stunt burger left over from a demo can be topped with rich, truffley goodness. The burger demo was Jamie's first shoot as a food publicist (she's now the VP of digital and culture for downtown food and lifestyle PR firm, <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.beccapr.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=BeccaPR class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">BeccaPR</a>) and potentially Andrew's millionth–he was seasoned TV writer and producer with credits ranging from MTV's Boiling Points to countless food shows to Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Their instant chemistry and a job switch that left Andrew in need of endless food talent to book for a new morning show had them emailing daily, and after a successful second shoot, it was an equally-indulgent celebratory burger at <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.thespottedpig.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Spotted Pig" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Spotted Pig</a> that sealed the deal. After four years of dating, moving in together and a puppy named Dusty, Andrew proposed on the beach in Westhampton, in front of Jamie's parents home, almost a year ago today. "It was just us, and it was perfect," the bride recalled.</p><img alt="Happy, People in nature, Interaction, Love, Honeymoon, Romance, Travel, Hug, Gesture, Long hair, " title="Happy, People in nature, Interaction, Love, Honeymoon, Romance, Travel, Hug, Gesture, Long hair, " width=800 height=803 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482768994-hbz-wedding-05.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A wedding in the Hamptons, where they got engaged and spent their summers, seemed the perfect fit. And finding a location that was equal parts modern, chic and flexible for the area's temperamental weather proved easier than they anticipated. "We watched [<a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://parrishart.org data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Parrish Art Museum" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Parrish Art Museum</a>] go up over the past few years and immediately fell in love with the incredible architecture, the landscape and the vineyard it's set on. We loved that our guests were going to be able to explore the museum during cocktail hour and that the terrace was perfect for our reception–rain or shine," Jamie explained. "Our ceremony site was perfectly situated under the [museum's] geometric pillars and looked out over the vineyard. We knew it was the place we wanted to get married the second we saw it." The reception space at the museum was a blank slate in the middle of a rustic vineyard–it was "dramatic, earthy and natural–while also being minimalist and modern." Without having to pipe and drape and add stereotypically event-esque touches to the space to make it work for them, the couple was sold.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jamie's mother, Jane Siskin, has been in fashion for decades and most recently launched the it-girl favorite contemporary womenswear line, <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://cinqasept.nyc/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cinq à Sept" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Cinq à Sept</a>. Once Jamie had chosen her Monique Lhuillier gown, there was no one better to design the bridesmaids dresses and the MOH dress than her mother. "We chose blush to compliment the blush tones of [my] bridal gown, and as a reference to [my] rose gold engagement ring," the bride said. The design team at Cinq à Sept also made a lace top to go over the Jamie's gown for the ceremony, which she accessorized with Tabitha Simmons shoes, and her rehearsal dinner dress, which is pictured above. For the big day, the mother of the bride selected a printed look from Temperley London, with touches of all the colors in the wedding's blush, indigo and ivory palette.</p><img alt="Clothing, Room, Interior design, Dress, Floor, Textile, Flooring, Photograph, Living room, White, " title="Clothing, Room, Interior design, Dress, Floor, Textile, Flooring, Photograph, Living room, White, " width=2000 height=1990 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482773287-hbz-wedding-02.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="Event, Trousers, Dress, Social group, Formal wear, Gown, Beauty, Youth, Fashion, Tradition, " title="Event, Trousers, Dress, Social group, Formal wear, Gown, Beauty, Youth, Fashion, Tradition, " width=1992 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482770026-hbz-wedding-07.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="Clothing, Dress, Textile, Photograph, White, Formal wear, Style, Bridal clothing, Wedding dress, Gown, " title="Clothing, Dress, Textile, Photograph, White, Formal wear, Style, Bridal clothing, Wedding dress, Gown, " width=1992 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482769962-hbz-wedding-03.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The ceremony at the museum turned out to be their second. "We got married legally on Friday, at the Town Hall in Westhampton, and one of Andrew's oldest friends from summer camp, Michael Landsburg, performed the Jewish ceremony on Sunday. (Fun fact: Internet-ordained ministers cannot legally perform marriage ceremonies in Suffolk County). The service at The Parrish was celebratory, light and fun," explained the couple. Underneath a <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://putnamflowers.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Putnam & Putnam" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Putnam & Putnam</a>-decorated floral arch overlooking the vineyards, the couple exchanged vows in their Jewish ceremony. As a mid-ceremony surprise, in addition to the tradition of sharing wine from a kiddish cup, their friend and officiant presented the couple with a chocolate chip cookie (an ode to their favorite snack) for them to each take a bite of as not only a religious union, but a union that was unique to them as a couple.</p><img alt="Suit, Dress, Formal wear, Bridal clothing, Daylighting, Bride, Marriage, Veil, Ceremony, Wedding dress, " title="Suit, Dress, Formal wear, Bridal clothing, Daylighting, Bride, Marriage, Veil, Ceremony, Wedding dress, " width=2000 height=1333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482770809-hbz-wedding-16.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The details outside of the menu were not lost on the couple, who each specialize in planning and producing events and shoots to the very last detail. Working with superstar vendors was the first step–the couple enlisted <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://dukevandeusen.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Duke + Van Deusen" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Duke + Van Deusen</a> to help them orchestrate the affair and Putnam & Putnam for jaw-dropping design that brought the lush outdoors in seamlessly–and then some.

Invites were edged in rose gold foil–another call to Jamie's ring. Menus and escort cards were packaged with craft paper, a nod to the couple's desire for a truly laid-back vibe with a sophisticated polish.</p><img alt="Brown, Text, Paper product, Font, Teal, Paper, Handwriting, Beige, Rectangle, Wedding invitation, " title="Brown, Text, Paper product, Font, Teal, Paper, Handwriting, Beige, Rectangle, Wedding invitation, " width=1000 height=500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482774161-hbz-wedding-21.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another move that drove home an easygoing feel was the couple's choice in photographer <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://johndolan.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Dolan" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">John Dolan</a>, who employs a more documentary, candid and genuine style of shooting than most classic wedding-day shooters. A focus on the intimate moments shared between the couple and with their family and friends kept the photos of the wedding as true to the moments they captured as possible–without fluff, fuss or force. An impromptu photo session with John during their cocktail hour helped Jamie and Andrew capture moments that still felt effortless and easy rather than uncharacteristically posed.</p><img alt="Clothing, Coat, Dress, Event, Trousers, Bridal clothing, Suit, Wedding dress, Photograph, Bride, " title="Clothing, Coat, Dress, Event, Trousers, Bridal clothing, Suit, Wedding dress, Photograph, Bride, " width=1000 height=500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482774373-hbz-wedding-22.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="Clothing, Dress, Bridal clothing, Wedding dress, Bride, Marriage, Bridge, Bridal veil, Love, Gown, " title="Clothing, Dress, Bridal clothing, Wedding dress, Bride, Marriage, Bridge, Bridal veil, Love, Gown, " width=1992 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482774489-hbz-wedding-06.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Food, understandably, was of utmost importance–as was the overall experience for the couple and their guests. The pressure was on–with their both loving and working in food–for the event to deliver on style and taste. The Putnams created one-of-a-kind indigo table linens and napkins as well as the ribbon that tied the bride's bouquet in collaboration with <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://erinconsidine.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Erin Considine" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Erin Considine</a>. "Our overall goal was making our guests feel comfortable and enabling them to have as much fun as possible–so we removed anything that we felt could be interpreted as formal or fussy, Jamie said. Low centerpieces to encourage conversation and keep tables feeling intimate as well as minimal silverware and stemless glasses kept the vibe laid-back. Small restaurant-like touches, like a communal bread basket and family style side dishes were used to keep guests feeling like they were dining at one of the couple's favorite NYC spots–or at the best version of one of their at-home dinner parties.</p><img alt="Tablecloth, Dishware, Textile, Table, Serveware, Linens, Furniture, Bouquet, Floristry, Centrepiece, " title="Tablecloth, Dishware, Textile, Table, Serveware, Linens, Furniture, Bouquet, Floristry, Centrepiece, " width=1000 height=667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482772107-hbz-wedding-15.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="Petal, Flower, Bouquet, Flowering plant, Beige, Tan, Floral design, Flower Arranging, Cut flowers, Floristry, " title="Petal, Flower, Bouquet, Flowering plant, Beige, Tan, Floral design, Flower Arranging, Cut flowers, Floristry, " width=3000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482774423-hbz-comp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The goal of the cocktail and dinner menu was comfort and fun–and meeting the expectations of the guests who were all too excited to eat the food Jamie and Andrew loved. "We immediately fell in love with <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sonnier-castle.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sonnier & Castle" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sonnier & Castle</a>'s food and their incredibly beautiful, yet simple presentations," Jamie explained. "We went way over the top with the menu"–which included nostalgic hors d'oeuvres like upscale buffalo chicken meatballs, all-beef pigs in a blanket and truffled baked potatoes, a tuscan table of breads, veggies, charcuterie and spreads at cocktail hour and a seated dinner of fall burrata salad, short rib and/or black bass paired with irresistible sides and a dessert array of cookies and wedding cake peppered with nostalgic touches like a snowball dessert with marshmallow fluff and a brownie parfait. "We wanted there to be something for everyone," said the couple. They considered their menu an "end of summer" celebration, and themed the menu as such. At the cocktail hour, guests were welcomed with a drink–a choice of either an Aperol Spritz or a cold rosé.</p><img alt="Blue, Trousers, Dress, Photograph, Bridal clothing, Suit, Coat, Floor, Formal wear, Bride, " title="Blue, Trousers, Dress, Photograph, Bridal clothing, Suit, Coat, Floor, Formal wear, Bride, " width=1336 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482772300-hbz-wedding-08.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="Food, Whole food, Vegan nutrition, Ingredient, Tableware, Table, Natural foods, Local food, Food group, Produce, " title="Food, Whole food, Vegan nutrition, Ingredient, Tableware, Table, Natural foods, Local food, Food group, Produce, " width=1000 height=667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482772171-hbz-wedding-14.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cocktail hour in the gallery setting, a reception on the terrace and an after party in the theatre allowed the couple to create limitless food experiences for their guests. "For dinner, we opted for French service, having servers offer each guest a bit of fish and/or short rib and had all side dishes served family style. For dessert, in addition to wedding cake (which was made by my pastry school classmate and decorated by Putnam & Putnam) we had the folks from <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://dreesenscatering.com/donuts data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dreesen's Donuts" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dreesen's Donuts</a> (an East Hampton favorite) frying fresh donuts inside of the party.

The most fun food, however, was during the after party—"Andrew is from Philadelphia, so Philly-style soft pretzels were shipped in and passed around the dance floor, in addition to mini Shake Shack-style burgers, mini bacon, egg & cheese sandwiches on biscuits and French toast sticks."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To bring warmth and a lush feel into the minimalistic gallery space, the couple enlisted Putnam's help to deck the space with blooms and whimsical touches. A floral installation floated over the dance floor, and arches of blooms were placed at key entry points to the venue. A hand-cut indigo, white and metallic silver paper fringe background in the same palette as their linens was hung for a photo booth, which was flanked by vintage lounge furniture from <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://rentpatina.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rent Patina" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rent Patina</a>. For the after party, disco ball clusters of all different sizes were installed over the dance floor for a focal point in the Parrish's theatre.</p><img alt="Drum, Event, Trousers, Entertainment, Performing arts, Coat, Idiophone, Musician, Dress, Suit, " title="Drum, Event, Trousers, Entertainment, Performing arts, Coat, Idiophone, Musician, Dress, Suit, " width=2000 height=1429 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482772665-hbz-wedding-18.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Music, in addition to the menu, was incredibly important to the couple for an even more sentimental reason. The groom's late father, Louis Goldstein was a sax player in a wedding band by night and a forensic psychologist by day. For the couple's first dance, Andrew had a 20+ year old recording of his dad playing Billy Joel's "Just The Way You Are" remastered. "The band played the recording through the end of Louis' sax solo and then picked up and took over. It was perfect." The band, <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.generationevents.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="City of Six of Generation Events" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">City of Six of Generation Events</a>, played for the rest of the night and kept the entire room on their feet: "they are the most incredible band I've ever heard (but I'm obviously biased)–everyone was up dancing the entire night," the bride recalled.</p><img alt="Eyewear, Face, Arm, Vision care, Fun, Event, Social group, Hand, Party, Fashion accessory, " title="Eyewear, Face, Arm, Vision care, Fun, Event, Social group, Hand, Party, Fashion accessory, " width=2000 height=1333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482773791-hbz-wedding-19.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="People, Event, Dress, Party, Crowd, Ceremony, Flash photography, Love, Tie, Function hall, " title="People, Event, Dress, Party, Crowd, Ceremony, Flash photography, Love, Tie, Function hall, " width=2000 height=1353 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/52/1482773853-hbz-wedding-10.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The.End.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/916d9b02-8867-4c91-934d-6abbc239c04d_1547134719.png alt="Headshot of Carrie Goldberg" title="Headshot of Carrie Goldberg" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Carrie Goldberg is HarpersBAZAAR.com’s Weddings & Travel Director.

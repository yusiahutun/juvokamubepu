He was apparently enraged when he found out about Cheryl's affair and went as far as to spy on her.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>According to Leroy's testimony, Mykelti chased and attacked him and was stabbed in the abdomen for which he had to undergo surgery.

The actor has spent well over four decades in the industry and has likewise gained fame and fortune from it.</p><h2>Mykelti Williamson's Net Worth</h2><p>Mykelti was born on&nbsp;March 4, 1957, in St. Louis, Missouri.

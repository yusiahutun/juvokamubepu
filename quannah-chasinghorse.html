Chasinghorse grew up in Arizona, Mongolia, and New Mexico before returning to Alaska with her mother when she was six years old. She moved from Kenny Lake to Fairbanks.</p><p>Izzy Chasinghorse and Denali Black are the two helpful brothers she has got. Quannah was a student at Effie Kokrine Charter School in Fairbanks, Alaska. She didn’t come from a wealthy home, and she wanted to help her parents, so she put a lot of effort into her studies. She also focused on her ambitions for the future and took part in appropriate co-curricular activities.</p><h3>Quannah Chasinghorse Career</h3><p>Quannah Chasinghorse works for the Alaska Wilderness League as a fourth-generation land guard protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. She stated that she did not wish for future generations to be forced to go into war. She was a member of the International Gwich’in Youth Council when she was 17, and she traveled to Washington, D.C., New York, and Colorado. Quannah pushed against oil leasing that would harm the refuge and backed HR 11-46, a bill that would ensure the land’s permanent protection. Quannah took part in climate rallies both in her hometown and in Denver. She has spoken at a number of events and panels about climate action and indigenous rights.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u5e8d088791253d1036808a2cd78b292f><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Emilio Ballack Biography</span></a><p>Chasinghorse has always been interested in modeling and fashion, but she didn’t think it was a viable career option because of the lack of indigenous representation in publications and fashion shows.

<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Galway, Ireland | South China Morning Post</h1></header><section class=post-content><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Galway, on the west coast of the Republic of Ireland, has long been a prosperous trading centre. This 'City of Tribes' was named after 14 merchant families that dom-inated all aspects of life in the area from the 13th to the 19th centuries. Then, the old section of the city bustled with merchants trading wine, spices, salt and fish. These days, you can wander through picturesque alleyways and shop for Aran sweaters, Claddagh rings, Irish crafts and stylish clothing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Originating in the nearby Aran Islands, the complex textured stitch patterns of Aran jumpers are recognisable around the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The most popular patterns are the honeycomb (a symbol of the hard-working bee), the cable (representing part of fishermen's daily life), the diamond (for success and wealth) and the basket (in anticipation of a plentiful catch).</p>Galway Woollen Market (below left, 21 High Street, tel: 353 91 562491; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.sweatershop.ie</span></a>) sells Aran sweaters (from Euro33/HK$345) and woollen jumpers (from Euro64). These machine-made garments are cheaper than the genuine handmade jumpers, which cost about Euro100. Down the street at Fallers Sweater Shop (below right, 25 High Street, tel: 353 91 564833) you can pick up an Aran jumper for Euro29.95 or two for Euro55. The creations in both shops come in a rainbow of colours. Also, try one of Ireland's oldest clothing stores, O'Maille (16 High Street, tel: 353 91 562696; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.omaille.com</span></a>), 'the Original House of Style', for Aran jumpers, capes, wraps and other warm Irish-designed clothing. The oldest fishing village in Ireland, The Claddagh, was situated outside the walls of the city of Galway, overlooking Galway Bay. Some houses still bear the Claddagh insignia. Pop into Claddagh Jewellers (Shop Street, tel: 353 91 562554; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.claddaghjewellers.com</span></a>) for his and hers matching Claddagh rings. A ring worn on the right hand with the crown turned inwards signifies the wearer is single. If it's worn with the crown turned outwards it means love is being considered. Worn on the left hand, with the crown turned outwards, it indicates the wearer is spoken for. Rings range in price from Euro50 (faux amethyst) to more than Euro800 (emerald and platinum). In 1963, John F. and Jackie Kennedy were presented with a pair of Fallers Claddagh rings during a visit to Galway. Fallers (Williamsgate Street, tel: 353 91 561226; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.fallers.com</span></a>) is still trading and sells Claddagh rings (from Euro45 to Euro1,500) just like those JFK and Jackie owned. The shop sells other stylish gifts such as Waterford crystal pieces and clan shields (from Euro100). Irish department store Kilkenny (6 High Street, tel: 353 91 566 110; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.kilkennyshop.com</span></a>) sells jewellery, crafts and a wide range of Irish pottery by artists from all over the country. Head upstairs for fashion and the latest Waterford crystal designs. Shopping in Galway isn't all jumpers and jewellery: menswear stores such as River Island (14 Shop Street, tel: 353 91 568310; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.riverisland.com</span></a>) proliferate in the old section of town. And at Anthony Ryans (16 Shop Street, tel: 353 91 567061; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.anthonyryans</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">com), stylish pink-striped Bugatti business shirts (Euro69.95) are all the rage. You can also pick up a tie clip (Euro22.95), Bugatti coat (from Euro279) and Carl Gross suit (from Euro410).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdlbYZ5hJFonpqkp5bGbrXRnqOappQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./audrey-mcgraw-sultry-unexpected-performance-far-away-from-home.html><span>←</span><span>Audrey McGraw looks sultry in unexpected, intimate performance far away from home</span></a>

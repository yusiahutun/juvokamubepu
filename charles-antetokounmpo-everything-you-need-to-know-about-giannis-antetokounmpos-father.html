Here’s everything we know about him.</strong></p><p>Charles Antetokounmpo is famous for being the father of Giannis Antetokounmpo, a Nigerian-Greek Professional Basketball Player. Giannis’s path to stardom began when he was discovered by a Greek basketball scout, leading to his signing with a professional team in Greece and eventually being drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in 2013.</p><p>Since then, he has consistently impressed with his outstanding skills and has become an inspiration to many aspiring basketball players. With his immense physical abilities and remarkable work ethic, Giannis has the potential to be remembered as one of the greatest players of all time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/9ce38ad71ec3dc71842094527579e640-fotor-2023061922225.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Charles_Antetokounmpo></span>Who Is Charles Antetokounmpo?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charles Antetokounmpo, born on August 3, 1963, in Nigeria, was a Nigerian football player originally from Lagos. He spent his early years in Nigeria before eventually relocating to Greece for better opportunities in 1992.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/690ec5981a3a0a824867f420289299b1-fotor-20230619222439-edited.jpg><p>Unfortunately, little information about his parents’ names, education, college, or other details is available.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Charles_Antetokounmpo_Support_Giannis></span>Did Charles Antetokounmpo Support Giannis?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Giannis’ journey to success was far from easy. Growing up in poverty in Greece, Giannis faced numerous obstacles throughout his childhood. This was because his father faced a lot of struggles to make ends meet. Giannis often had to contribute by taking on odd jobs and selling goods on the streets.</p><p>Nevertheless, he was relentless in making a name for himself. Throughout the early days of Giannis’ career, Charles was a major support to his son. He worked so hard to get Giannis and his brothers their first boots. Charles never hesitated to make sacrifices for his kids.</p><p>In addition to his on-court success, Giannis has ventured into other endeavors. He recently opened a shop called AntetokounBros with his four <a href=#>brothers </a>at the Athens airport, showcasing his entrepreneurial spirit. Furthermore, he has secured lucrative endorsement deals with brands like Nike and WhatsApp, contributing to his estimated net worth of $70 million as of September 2021.</p><p>With such fame and wealth accumulated by his son, it’s understandable why everyone wants to know about Charles Antetokounmpo and his role in his son’s success story.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Charles_Antetokounmpos_Wife></span>Charles Antetokounmpo’s Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Veronica Antetokounmpo was Charles’ loving wife for over two decades. Veronica was born on April 7, 1964, in Nigeria. She was raised in Lagos, Nigeria, and belongs to the Igbo ethnic group. Veronica excelled in the field of athletics, particularly as a high jumper. However, just like Charles, she is famous for being the mother of Giannis Antetokounmpo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Children_Does_Charles_Antetokounmpo_Have></span>How Many Children Does Charles Antetokounmpo Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charles and his wife had five children, Francis, Thanasis, Giannis, Kostas, and Alex. Of all his children, his oldest son is the only one who doesn’t play basketball. Francis (Ofili) Antetokounmpo is a retired professional soccer player who now lives in Greece. He is also involved in music and released his debut single and music video in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanasis Antetokounmpo, the second eldest son, is a professional basketball player. He has played for various teams in Greece, the Delaware 87ers, and Westchester Knicks in the NBA Development League.</p><p>Kostas Antetokounmpo, the second youngest brother, has played basketball for teams such as the Philadelphia 76ers, Dallas Mavericks, and Los Angeles Lakers and currently plays for the Turkish squad Fenerbahçe Beko. He made history as the first Greek-born player to win an NBA championship in 2020, also achieved by his brothers Giannis and Thanasis in 2021.</p><p>Alex Antetokounmpo, the youngest brother, is a professional basketball player who has played for teams such as UCAM Murcia in Spain and the Raptors 905 in the NBA G League. He was acquired by the Wisconsin Herd, the G League affiliate of the Milwaukee Bucks, in July 2022. Alex is considered a promising talent and has the support of his older brothers in his basketball career. However, of all his children, Giannis, the middle child, is the most famous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/c89bb171765bfd0080173df7ab972a1a-fotor-20230619222636.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Charles_Antetokounmpo_Today></span>Where Is Charles Antetokounmpo Today?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sadly, Charles Antetokounmpo tragically passed away from a heart attack on September 29, 2017, at 54. The incident occurred while he was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the United States. In 2017 Giannis broke down in tears after being named the Most Valuable Player of the 2018-19 NBA regular season. He dedicated the prestigious award to his late father.</p><p>On August 3, 2020, Giannis also shared a video to pay tribute to his late father, who would have turned 57 that day. The video was a combination of old photos showing the humble beginnings of himself and his brothers in Greece. He wrote, “I know you are proud and smiling in Heaven! Happy birthday, Daddy.”</p><p>While Charles is no more, the sacrifices he made for his sons to reach the level of success they are in today will never be forgotten. The movie <a href=#>Rise </a>which tells the story of Charles and his family, paints a better picture of their beautiful story.</p><p>Another celebrity dad everyone wants to know about is Jenna Ortega’s <a href=#>father</a>, Edward Ortega. He is a pillar of support to his daughter and part of her success story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksKmt0aWcrGWRo8GmwM6kpq6mnaW8brHVnqmyrJieu6h52KisZqaVmrFuwM5moqenp2Kuo7vUrWSgoZGju6q%2FjJqlrZ2kpLiwwc2mp6irXZuutbTEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./acne-products-sensitive-skin.html><span>←</span><span>Alternative Acne Solutions to Benzoyl Peroxide</span></a>

Pat would have competed at this year's X Games had it not been for the tragic accident.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The fairgrounds were littered with not only the t-shirts but stickers and placards from fans all paying tribute, as well as a great deal of medals and insane stunts dedicated to his memory.</p><p>The athlete's family were at the fairgrounds in his honor – with many fans in attendance expressing the sentiment that they were viewing this summer's event as Pat's final appearance at the X Games.</p><p>Casey is survived by his wife Chase Casey and their children – eight-year-old son Reid, already a BMX biker, and daughter seven-year-old Taytum.</p><p>On Saturday – which at over 23,000 in attendance was by far the biggest day for the games – BMX legend Jamie Bestwick held a moment of silence on the BMX Dirt run with the competitors and Casey's family present.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"He was driven by his commitment, courage and an unwavering drive to prove impossible was absolutely possible," said Bestwick.</p><p>"He knew the greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."</p><p>"Pat was a shining example of fatherhood and devotion to a woman and family that he truly loved," he concluded. "For Pat Casey, today let's go for gold."</p><p>When Ryan Williams ultimately won gold for the BMX Best Trick competition that afternoon, he pledged his entire prize money to Casey’s family in attendance.</p><p>Casey won his first X Games medal (bronze) when he was just 14 in 2012. He then went on to win silver the following year. Then in 2021 Casey finally earned a gold medal.</p><p>He died June 6 after losing control of his bike at the Slayground Motorcross Park in Ramona, California.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7260d444-374d-4442-a39a-46e19ffe372d data-container-ref=toofab:article:281a6b58-50a2-4e74-b7ca-6fc9d751b52f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ce/5by4/2023/02/04/ceb2476876b14c62b09ec90c9704ae1c_xs.jpeg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Marcus Skin / Monster Energy</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">5 Female Monster Extreme Snow Athletes You Need to Be Following Right Now</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bma2xfoa61sYybpLFlo6mus3nPmqtmm5Gosrp5x6ilqKqVmXqiwIytn6KrXa6yor7SZq9mn5GisrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-foley-baby-reindeer.html><span>←</span><span>Is He the Real Darrien From Richard Gadds Life?</span></a>

The family often share their religious celebrations with fans online and celebrate the Jewish holidays. Yet in Jewish religion and culture, being tattooed is often frowned upon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/10d4176479be-3-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e5YSI1jrJQXL data-wc=12><strong>The aspiring chef has a Star of David tattooed on his hand</strong></p><p id=e5j_FI30BY-t data-wc=61>The devasting reason behind this has links to the <a class=hm-link href=#>Holocaust</a>. During the Second World War, Jews living in camps were tattooed by the Nazis with a number. While some liberal Jews embraced tattooing as an act of defiance against this harrowing history, many members of the Jewish community are still very much haunted by the memory of tattooing during the Holocaust.</p><p id=eXd0Px1uY-K5 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Holocaust survivor Ruth Posner on wartime horrors, hiding and hope</a></strong></p><p id=eptWcR0HqvCo data-wc=38>Moreover, according to the Torah (Leviticus 19:28), "You shall not make gashes in your flesh for the dead, or incise any marks on yourselves". This is a well-known aversion that has led many Jews to avoid the needle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cb9d1a2ed896-2-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eFz_bqI389aZ data-wc=11><strong>The Peltz family are proud of their Jewish ancestry and heritage</strong></p><p id=eHl0T_HMXbKd data-wc=65>However, in recent years, an increasing number of Jews have been experimenting with tattoos as the anti-tatt trope is losing its significance. <strong>Tattoos are seen more as fashion statements or an outward expression of the inner self in today's zeitgeist,</strong> meaning that while the turbulent history of Jews with tattoos remains ever-relevant, followers of the Jewish faith are toying with body art more and more.</p><p id=eHP1Rl9Q2hwQ data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Brooklyn Beckham unveils new poignant tattoo dedicated to wife Nicola Peltz</a></strong></p><p id=eqdlB_MREocl data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Brooklyn Beckham unveils touching bunny tattoo in honour of Nicola Peltz's family</a></strong></p><p id=eERxrwuXDaX3 data-wc=51>So, whether or not the Peltz clan take issue with Brooklyn's inkings, it's clear the 23-year-old has positive intentions behind his needlework.

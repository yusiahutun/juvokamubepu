I think it's human nature."</p><p>Asked if she ever tried to actively sabotage another female's career, she replied: "Never, never, never, never."</p><p>"I think I just wish that maybe I had extended myself more, and shown people the ropes a little bit more," she added.

And I did include the fact that she said it was dumb and disrespectful, it was stupid and arrogant and quite a bit of what she said. There was another line that I thought was — I wasn't sure what she meant exactly, and I thought it was subject to interpretation."</p><p>"What I wish I had done is asked a follow up to clarify, or just run it and let her clarify it later, but I think the most pertinent and direct response to the question about Colin Kaepernick I included, and that's why I raised it because maybe I should have done the other sentence, as well."</p><p>Pressed by Guthrie, she admitted the decision was wrong.</p><p>"Ultimately, I think I should have included it," added. "But I also think it's really important to look at what I did include. She had to make a statement afterwards saying her comments were harsh and dismissive."</p><p>"I still believe I used the most critically important response, but I think you're right, I think it would have illuminated it even more if I had included that other statement."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f0b4374e-7863-4a2e-b339-d151472102b8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:611130eb-02e4-422e-a227-d28a0131f0a6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a5/5by4/2021/10/01/a5e99e8c192c468297509cad7de2a3a8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Katie Couric Reveals Alleged Texts Sent to Matt Lauer After His Sexual Misconduct Firing</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGlmanFfoK61tcRmmqitop6wbrDEp6Ceq12orqO705qeoqaXYrOmucClnGaqmauurb%2BMnJirnZWnwG6wxJ%2Bcp5yjYrKltdOipaBlope0br3UqKueq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-evans-went-to-extreme-lengths-to-keep-his-intimate-wedding-a-secret.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Evans went to extreme lengths to keep his 'intimate wedding' a secret</span></a>

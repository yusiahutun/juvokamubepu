<a href=../../../zoe-kravitz-channing-tatum-paris-fashion-week-couple-style.html></a>
Zoë Kravitz and Channing Tatum didn’t hesitate to enjoy a PDA-filled outing during Paris Fashion Week.
The couple, who attended Saint Laurent’s Spring/Summer 2024 runway show last night, were photographed exiting the venue hand in hand with smiles on their faces. They cutely coordinated in all-black ensembles.
Kravitz looked fabulous in a micro minidress draped in layers of black mesh fabric adorned all over with large white polka dots. She capped off the look with a pair of glossy black pump slingbacks, pearl stud earrings, a long rectangular black clutch, and—for a pop of color—a bright red manicure.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Frank Gore</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>

And as my anxiety grows — you see, I, too, understand the bubble of time, ingredients and trust that we invest into new recipes, which, when popped, leads to the kind of frustration that can only be righted with a scalding review — I wonder if this will be it, the day I finally make an Ottolenghi recipe that’s just plain off.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Best Smoothie Cookbooks on Amazon</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>

While I’m most certainly not the most health-conscious person in existence, I do try to get my nutrients in whenever I can—even if this means chugging a cold-pressed green juice after a stint at Taco Bell (embarrassingly enough, it’s my absolute favorite guilty pleasure). Because I like junk food, I find the need to supplement my meals with healthy, antioxidant-rich smoothies to compensate for the inflammatory foods that I eat on the regular.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Vogue Williams makes 'small boobs' confession as she presents new E4 show</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>

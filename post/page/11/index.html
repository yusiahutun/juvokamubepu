For as long as I can remember, the celebrity ‘It’ bag has been so out of my reach that I’ve paid it next to no attention. A-listers love Birkins? Great. Feel free to remind me if I ever come into $43,500. And the same can be said for the Jennifer Lawrence- and Rihanna-worn Dior Saddle Bag which I have never once considered adding to cart thanks to its $4,2000 price tag.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How ballet ruined and repaired my relationship with my body</h2><time>Sep 21, 2024</time>

I hit puberty quite late, which many might consider a blessing in disguise&nbsp;but I actually think it was the root cause of my body issues growing up.
I was totally flat-chested and petite until my mid-teens then rapidly began to fill out when I hit 18, and my confidence spiralled downwards from there.
I was competitively dancing at the time, having been in classical ballet training from the age of five.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>MCT, XTC, &amp;amp; Brain Octane Explained</h2><time>Sep 21, 2024</time>

Coconut oil has been touted for its topical, “off-label” beauty benefits for decades. It’s one of those O.G. multi-purpose products able to transform from a basic cooking staple into a damage-reversing hair mask, a DIY makeup remover, and can even double as an all-natural deodorant. However, with the rising popularity of the ketogenic diet in recent years, coconut oil’s amassed a large following as an oral supplement (specifically, MCT and Brain Octane Oil) marketed as a diet ally to promote accelerated weight loss, improved cognition, and stabilized energy levels by helping the body burn fat for energy instead of carbs, sugar, and even protein.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cher overreacts after Twitter fan claims Nicki Minaj 'dissed' her in rap song</h2><time>Sep 20, 2024</time>

"I didn't feel like I had control over anything else in my life, but food was something I could control," Zayn Malik recalled. It's often women in Hollywood who open up about their struggles with disordered eating, but many men also deal with the same issues. While it's not frequently spoken about, millions of men are also impacted, with the National Eating Disorders Association reporting that 10 million males will be affected by eating disorders at some point in life.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bunny-Approved Picks For Brunch, Dinner &amp;amp; Dessert</h2><time>Sep 19, 2024</time>

Out of all the beautiful holidays, Easter is the prettiest by far. There, I said it! I’m a sucker for pastels, bunnies and flowers—and of course, I love a good brunch, too.

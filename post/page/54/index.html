Calling out, calling out
Haven’t you wondered
Why I’m always alone
When you’re in my dreams
Calling out, calling out
Haven’t you wondered
Why you’re finding it hard
Just looking at me
I want you
But I want you to understand
I leave you
I love you
Didn’t want to leave you
With the wrong impression
Didn’t want to leave you
With my last confession
Of love

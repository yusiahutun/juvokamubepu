Despite an 11th-hour attempt to save it, the Southways estate - once heralded as the most expensive home in Minnesota - was razed to the ground on August 28.
The palatial historic property built in 1919 as the summer home of the Pillsbury family, of the flour and cookie dough fame, had spent a decade on the market before the city of Orono issued a demolition permit last month to the property's current owner, Jim Jundt.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Isabel Bloom celebrates 60th anniversary</h2><time>Mar 9, 2024</time>

Lisa Marie Presley's final home was a spectacular estate in California, and pictures show an ultra-luxurious property that was a fitting residence for rock music royalty.
As celebrity real estate Dirt.com reports, Presley spent the final years of her life in a 6-bedroom, 7-bathroom, 7,440-square-foot mansion in an exclusive area of Calabasas, Calif.

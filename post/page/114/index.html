Every year, Diane von Furstenberg puts a spotlight on inspiring women making change across the globe with the DVF Awards. This year, Karlie Kloss will be amongst the women honored at the 8th Annual DVF Awards in New York.
The designer and supermodel announced the news via Facebook this morning that Kloss would be receiving the 2017 Inspiration Award. Between her organization that helps young women and girls learn how to code, Kode With Klossy, and her gluten-free cookie line, Klossies, that benefit FEED and the CFDA, Kloss's philanthropic work both in and out of the fashion world make her the perfect choice for the award.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Birthday Gift Kid Rock Got From Bud Light Manufacturer</h2><time>Apr 1, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../kid-rock-bud-light-present.html></a>
Kid Rock revealed on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast that he received 100 cases of Bud Light from manufacturer Anheuser-Busch for his birthday this past year.
That may seem odd, as Rock's shooting up cases of Bud Light with his machine gun last year became one of 2023's more viral moments, but it also is part of the long strange journey that now sees the musician calling for fans to move on after last year's dustup over the beer company's use of trans activist Dylan Mulvaney in a promotional campaign.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The fascinating history of the catwalk show</h2><time>Apr 1, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../history-catwalk-show.html></a>
For several decades, the circus of fashion week has been an international event, a pop-culture phenomenon which captures the interest of millions as designers present their latest collections, models strut their stuff on the catwalk, celebrities perch immaculately on the front row and editors dart from one city to another, several times a year. More recently though, the role of the runway show has come into question following the explosion of social media, a reckoning regarding sustainability and, more recently, a global pandemic which halted travel and gatherings of people, all of which has led to a more digital-focused fashion week.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Top Rated Libido Pill That Went Viral Is Back in Stock at Target</h2><time>Apr 1, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../maureen-mccormick-gushes-about-the-brady-bunch-cast-reuniting.html></a>
Our prayers were answered when HGTV decided to reunite the surviving&nbsp;The Brady Bunch cast to film their new show A Very Brady Renovation. While going down memory lane,&nbsp;Maureen McCormick — who’s known for playing Marcia Brady — admits it was “surreal” for them to share the screen again.
“Very surreal. Very surreal,” Maureen, 63, exclusively gushed to Closer Weekly — calling it an “out-of-body experience.”
The show took less than a year to film and, even though Maureen had a great time catching up with Barry Williams, Christopher Knight, Eve Plumb, Mike Lookinland and Susan Olsen, the actress noted that they weren’t always filming the show as a unit.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/113/>← Prev Page</a>

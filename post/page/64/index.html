The distraught sister of the latest 'victim' of Long Island 'serial killer' Rex Heuermann' wept outside of court as she said 'losing Maureen has become a wound that never truly heals.'
Melissa Cann, 39, trembled when she spoke about the death of her older sister, Maureen Brainard-Barnes after Heuermann was charged with second degree murder on Tuesday at Suffolk County Criminal Court as he pleaded not guilty.

<a href=../../../everything-know-about-jelly-nail-polishes.html></a>
If there's one nail trend that's on our radar this summer, it's the jelly manicure (not to be confused with hard-to-remove gels). So, what are jelly nail polishes exactly? Like creams, mattes, and opalescents, the term jelly refers to the texture of the formula once it's applied. The difference with jellies, though, is that they offer a splash of sheer color and loads of shine—kind of like lip gloss, except for your nails.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>School Bus Driver Won't Be Charged For Drinking White Claw On Job Didn't Know It Was Alcoholic</h2><time>Jun 21, 2024</time>

"It was just a mistake, it was a mistake," the NOW FIRED 60-year-old woman, who is undergoing chemo, pleaded after being caught drinking the alcoholic beverage while driving students home. A school bus driver in Long Island insists she didn't know she was drinking an alcoholic beverage while driving high school students -- and local police believe her.
The 60-year-old, Amal Hanna, claimed she thought the hard seltzer was simply a carbonated beverage and was unable to tell the difference due to the side effects of her chemotherapy treatments for cancer.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Womens Day: Unrealistic Beauty Standards and Mental Health</h2><time>Jun 21, 2024</time>

Women, for centuries, have been told by men that they are “not up to the mark”. The first wave of the feminist movement can be traced back to the mid-1800s with the first formal effort being made in 1848 with the signing of the Declaration of Sentiments which called for women to be brought up to the same level as men through advocacy of multiple rights which included the right to vote.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>British Airways air hostess leaves fans on cloud nine with stunning bikini snaps</h2><time>Jun 20, 2024</time>

A Harvard professor in Government and African American Studies drew attention from the school, posted a community note on X, and eventually offered what seemed to be a complete turnaround of her comments regarding Harvard Extension School students. This followed her attempt to critique a conservative writer and activist. Professor Jennifer L. Hochschild encountered significant criticism for a post on X, formerly Twitter, regarding writer and activist Christopher Rufo. Rufo played a pivotal role in exposing the past plagiarism of now-ousted Harvard president Claudine Gay.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lan Yu and Hold You Tight, daring films by Stanley Kwan, Hong Kong director, explore sexuality</h2><time>Jun 20, 2024</time>

Even though Yau was a big box-office draw, he almost passed on the project.
“Rumours and gossip had made me develop a bias against her,” he told the Post’s Winnie Chung in 1998. “But after meeting her, I realised that she was just a normal girl when you don’t compare her with her former films.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mongolian mummy buried in 'Adidas boots' 1,100 years ago</h2><time>Jun 20, 2024</time>

Stephen Colbert was hoping America would wake up on Tuesday with a newfound generosity and liberal spirit -- not unlike Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning-- just in time to vote in the midterm elections.

"What day is it?!"</p><p>The CBS host jumped out of bed and ran to his balcony to profess his excitement to "The Late Show" townspeople, including a young "boy," Gyllenhaal.</p><p>"Oh, what a beautiful morning!" Colbert exclaimed. "Say there, boy...charming boy!"</p><p>"Are you talking to me?" Gyllenhaal said. "I'm 37 years old."</p><p>The actor then informed the late-night host that it was the day before the midterm elections. In celebration, Colbert threw a coin at Gyllenhaal to go buy the "shiniest midterm goose" he could find, but he also gave the "Brokeback Mountain" actor a gift he didn't ask for. Colbert wasn't wearing pants.</p><p>"Do you know I can see up your nightgown, right?" Gyllenhaal said. "Seriously, dude you got to put on some briefs. I can see all the 'election returns' and they're swinging left."</p><p>Colbert continued to jump with enthusiasm over the election and Gyllenhaal replied, "Dude, let me be clear. I can see your entire penis!"</p><p>"Again, you really need to put on pants," he added.</p><p>Colbert said there was "no time" to throw on some underwear, because he had an important show to do.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?

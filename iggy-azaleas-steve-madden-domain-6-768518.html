In a span of 30 minutes, she spewed off five tweets expressing her disapproval.</p><p>“Everything in collaboration is supposed to be mutually approved. But Steve madden did the most disgusting photo shoot ever and never,” the singer began, with her next tweet reading, “Even told me about it, I’m just now seeing it as its uploaded on some random tumblr page and iam livid.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>She continued: “I worked really hard on the creative direction of both the shoes and the shoot I WAS involved with and in. I really feel it’s been,” “Tainted with these God awful images that Steve madden took appon themselves to create and share without my knowledge. Gross gross gross,” and “Ivd been bamoozeled with a tumblr page where everyone wears socks and takes unintentional crotch shots on pool toys. I’m in shock.”</p><p>The Tweets have since been deleted, but <a href=# rel=nofollow>Huffington Post captured the social media</a> rant before it was taken down and described the now-password-protected Tumblr content as “trippy images and gifs mixed with crotch shots of headless models, images of the star and floating text blocks with phrases including ‘Modern-day Spice Girls,’ and ‘Unapologetic, loud and fun.’ An unattributed quote also appeared on the page saying, ‘I wanted to make shoes your girlfriends would love and your boyfriends wouldn’t understand.’ “</p><p>Azalea took to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> later on Thursday to clarify and explain her reasoning behind the tweets.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Natalie/Iggy_Insta.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>For the record: I absolutely LOVE these images, they are from the shoot I directed for my Steve Madden campaign. Im incredibly proud of the shoes we’ve made together, as well as these images that I’ve been anxiously waiting to share with you all. What I had a “rant” about on Twitter isn’t in regards to these pictures, it was about another, different set of images i wasn’t a part of creating that I felt weren’t reflective of my vision and direction for the collection. I’m an artist and I’m extremely passionate and emotional and crazy sometimes because I care ALOoOoot about this shit! I love Steve and he gets it! Artists clash sometimes, it doesn’t mean I dislike the brand. I love Steve Madden as an individual and as a company. I have 3 more seasons I’m making with these guys and I’m going to enjoy it. Shit just happens sometimes and you gotta fight for what you believe in! I believe in this collection immensely; that’s why I just wanted it to be perfect. it comes out tomorrow and I hope you guys enjoy it because I put my heart and soul into them! Sorry for the drama! I didn’t mean for it to turn into some big blog situation (as usual) but I’m not gonna sit back and totally let Steve Madden get dragged under the bus because as a whole they’re awesome ppl. I just don’t support neoprene Jesus sandals WITH socks ;).

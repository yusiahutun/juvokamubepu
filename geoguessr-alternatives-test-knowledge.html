If you love geography, then you’ve no doubt given a shot in the past. The game challenges you to guess locations based on a brief look at Google Street View.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what if you’ve played too much Geoguessr and are starting to get a bit bored with it? Or perhaps just never got that interested in it in the first place? Or want more of a challenge? Then you’ll be happy to know that there are plenty of alternatives out there for you to consider giving a try. Here are five of the best for your consideration.</p><h2 id=the-city-map-quiz>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The City Map Quiz</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-city-map-quiz-geoguessr-alternative-game-screenshot.jpg><p>First up on this list, we have The City Map Quiz. If you’ve played a lot of Geoguessr and are looking for a similar challenge from a different perspective, then The City Map Quiz is an excellent option. As you might imagine given its name, The City Map Quiz is an online game where you have to try and guess what city you are in based only on its map.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Details such as landmarks, park names, and street names have all been cleared from the map, so the only clues you have to go off of are the geographical features such as rivers, streets, and the city layout as a whole.</p><p>The City Map Quiz has fewer options than you might have with Geoguessr, but you can choose to divide your games into just countries or continents to make things a little easier or harder if you so wish.</p><p>There are four options with every question here, so you won’t be guessing completely blindly, making this a great change of pace for anybody who is tired of Geoguessr.</p><h2 id=mapcrunch>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MapCrunch</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mapcrunch-geoguessr-alternative-game-screenshot.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Next up, we have MapCrunch. If you’re looking for an alternative to Geoguessr because you found the guessing process too difficult or competitive, then MapCrunch is a nice, relaxed alternative.</p><p>Unlike Geoguessr, MapCrunch doesn’t have any guessing element to it. Instead, MapCrunch simply allows you to randomly generate street views at the press of a button.</p><p>For some, this may seem counter-intuitive. But if you’re the type of person who likes having the opportunity to see the world without having to travel anywhere, then this can be an invaluable little tool.</p><p>Alternatively, you may simply want to have a good way to practice your geography skills with more of a challenge. In that case, MapCrunch is a great way to practice and study what the different regions of the world look like. There are even a variety of options that you can turn on and off, such as individual countries, continents, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=geoclash>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoClash</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/geoclash-geoguessr-alternative-game-screenshot.jpg><p>For a more direct alternative to Geoguessr, GeoClash is a great option to go with. At its core, GeoClash follows the same principles that Geoguessr does. You are given a location in the world at random, and based on its street view, you need to try and identify where you are. The main difference here is that GeoClash works entirely for multiplayer.</p><p>If you’ve ever wanted to know how to play Geoguessr with your friends or just need <a href=#>something to do when you’re bored online</a>, then this is a great alternative to regular Geoguessr.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You don’t need to make an account to play, though you can if you'd like to, and sharing the room with friends is as easy as giving them a code. The number of rounds, time limit, and number of continents included can all be adjusted to you and your friends’ liking, making this a valuable alternative to Geoguessr for anybody looking for a multiplayer solution.</p><h2 id=worldle>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Worldle</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/worldle-geoguessr-alternative-game-screenshot.jpg><p>Next up on this list comes Worldle. This is a spin-off on the concept of <a href=#>Wordle, the word guessing game that went viral</a>. Instead of words, however, Worldle gives you a silhouette of a country somewhere on the globe for you to try and guess. Beyond that, the format is quite similar to Wordle.</p><p>You have six guesses in which to try and get the correct answer, and each incorrect answer provides you with some information to help you refine your guesses. In the case of Worldle, this information is how far away your guess was, and in what direction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The distance away defaults to kilometers, but you change it to miles if you prefer in the settings. Beyond that, Worldle comes with the option to guess neighbors in a bonus round, as well as share how well you did by copying the results to your clipboard.</p><h2 id=gtaguessr>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GtaGuessr</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gtaguessr-geoguessr-alternative-game-screenshot.jpg><p>Finally, we have GtaGuessr. If you’re tired of Geoguessr because you’ve played it to death, and now it’s just simply too easy, then GtaGuessr provides a new challenge that might just scratch that itch. As you might have guessed from its name, GtaGuessr is essentially Geoguessr if it took place entirely on the map of GTA 5’s San Andreas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Obviously, this is quite a bit different from real-world locations. The map of San Andreas is understandably smaller than the entirety of the real world, which means that in order to remain difficult, some of the locations are pretty hard to get.</p><p>With that being said, however, GtaGuessr poses an entirely different challenge from real-world locations for this very reason. If you feel like you’ve thoroughly exhausted everything Geoguessr has to offer, then this is an excellent way to inject some new excitement while still keeping the format that you know and love.</p><p>Alternatively, if you’re just an avid GTA player and think that you know everything about San Andreas, then this can be a fun way to test those skills as well. After playing the game and checking out <a href=#>the best apps for Grand Theft Auto players</a>, this is the next best way to get your fix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=geoguessr-isn-rsquo-t-the-only-geography-game-out-there>Geoguessr Isn’t the Only Geography Game Out There</h2><p>As you can see, there are a whole host of different geography games out there that you can try. Regardless of what you’re looking for, be it something entirely new, something familiar, or just something you can play with your friends, there’s an alternative to Geoguessr that will suit you. Plus, geography games are a great way to improve your knowledge, and can teach you a lot about the world while you’re at it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGienqeXqrK0v9FmmKWslae7osDIr5ysZaSawLV5yqemsKSVmbSmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-the-biological-father-of-elliot-kingsley.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is the Biological Father of Elliot Kingsley?</span></a>

But that idea was dismissed for being too similar to Red Bull and the commercial and marketing team soon went to work on a new name.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Michael Schumacher's brother has regret about F1 icon as sibling's health battle continues</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>F1 confirms new Grand Prix in Madrid that puts future of established circuit at risk</a></b></p><p>And fans have been left furious after it was confirmed that AlphaTauri have been renamed Visa Cash App RB <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Formula One</a> team with immediate effect. The rebrand will see the two sister teams on the track ramped up as much as current rules allow as they now share a marketing and communications department.</p><p>But fans couldn’t care about the financial gains that both teams are set to profit from, instead loathing the idea of the name and also their incredibly cringey bio: “A <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Formula 1</a> team working weekends always pure vibes.” One comment on Twitter said: “I know the elite levels of all sports are only truly concerned with financial gain but even by the current extremely low expectations, that’s hilarious.”</p><p><b><i>What do you make of F1’s latest team name?

While another was hoping it was to be nothing more than a prank, saying: “Is today April 1st? Please say yes.”</p><p>The team, which has thankfully been known by the acronym V-CARB, is set to release their 2024 car and livery on February, 8, alongside drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Yuki Tsuonda – who remain with the team after finishing the season together as AlphaTauri drivers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8VqZp9pXay8s7%2FTZquemZ1iu6K5xGacr52iYoByhZRwcHBq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blue-bloods-fans-are-surprised-someone-is-left-out-of-family-dinner-in-season-11-photo-html.html><span>←</span><span>'Blue Bloods' Fans Are Surprised Someone Is Left Out of Family Dinner in Season 11 Photo</span></a>

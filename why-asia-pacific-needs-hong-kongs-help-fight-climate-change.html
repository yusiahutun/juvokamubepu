Hong Kong is a leading international bond market, and it has one of the world’s most active equity markets.</p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is making great strides in promoting the city as a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">green finance hub</span></a>, too.

Total assets of the city’s asset and wealth management business stood at US$4 trillion at the end of 2022, and it ranks as the second-largest private equity centre in Asia with US$212 billion under management.Hong Kong is also one of the world’s top <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">innovation hubs</span></a>, boasting a burgeoning start-up ecosystem and the research and development capabilities, technological infrastructure and capital markets to support it.Home-grown innovations have the potential to solve environmental challenges facing emerging and developing economies across the region. One example is EcoCeres, a home-grown company that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">converts used cooking oil</span></a> into low-carbon aviation fuel and is in the process of expanding into Malaysia.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/12/11/3244613_p_1702268411.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Asia-Pacific, meanwhile, is still home to many countries whose capital markets have yet to develop to the level needed to support them in the transition. Some countries in the region have yet to issue a green bond. The Asia-Pacific accounted for 50 per cent of total climate finance in 2022, but South Asia received just 4 per cent. China’s domestic climate finance mobilisation accounted for 51 per cent of the total.</p>There is both a substantial opportunity and a need for Hong Kong to become a go-to hub for private-sector firms and banks in the wider region that are looking to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">finance climate projects</span></a> or enhance their capacity to offer tailored climate finance products to help their clients become more resilient. However, channelling capital to the countries that need it most requires a multipronged, multi-stakeholder response.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We need to enhance the capacity of financial institutions, regulators and stock exchanges, both in Hong Kong and the wider region, to enable climate finance and climate projects to thrive and set more robust global financial standards.</p>This can help in structuring, evaluating and monitoring <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">climate finance instruments</span></a>. This includes better defining uses of proceeds, aligning them with applicable UN Sustainable Development Goals and additional factors related to governance and impact measurement.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong to launch subsidy scheme for green fintech start-ups, official says</span></p></a></h3>We also need to make it easier and more attractive for businesses and financial institutions in Hong Kong to invest in new climate opportunities in emerging and developing markets. One way to do this is by de-risking projects using <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">blended finance</span></a>, where small amounts of concessional donor funds are used to mitigate risks for investors and rebalance the risk-reward profiles of projects that can’t proceed on strictly commercial terms.We also need to encourage the growth of newer financial instruments, including transition bonds, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">blue bonds</span></a>, biodiversity finance and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">carbon markets</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Multilateral development banks can also support both the public and private sectors in creating enabling environments for such projects to thrive, thanks to having decades of experience navigating the political and economic terrains of these markets, de-risking projects through guarantees and mobilising equity and debt to finance them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To mitigate the risks posed by climate change and respond to the increasing value placed on sustainable businesses by investors, consumers and governments alike, becoming more climate-oriented will be key for private-sector companies in the Asia-Pacific to meet rising expectations and stay competitive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But this shift also offers the investment opportunity of a lifetime. With its deep pool of financial institutions and businesses looking for investment opportunities in emerging markets, Hong Kong is uniquely placed to capitalise on the wider region’s efforts to accelerate a resilient, inclusive transition. With sustainability moving up the agenda for all stakeholders, there has rarely been a better time to do so.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Riccardo Puliti is regional vice-president, Asia and the Pacific, at the International Finance Corporation</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZrCnoqGxcK3RraCcpJVkgHOBkmpqbWenncZurdKimGaokZi2p7XCZqWenZSoeqm7zaBkpKeenMButMSlp2aemZy1tXnCpaCmmaSaeqS0wKeeng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./niall-horan-s-new-model-girlfriend-jessica-serfaty-shows-incredible-figure-sexy-swimwear-shoot-html.html><span>←</span><span>Niall Horan's model girlfriend Jessica Serfaty shows off her incredible figure</span></a>

He doesn’t look like a guy who’s attempting boxing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s the difference – the feints, the foot movement, the way he lands shots. He fights like a boxer. He doesn’t fight like a guy who’s trying to box in a celebrity boxing match.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/07/33b3341c-9951-4e26-bd3f-fbc4a46226cd_2a7943b3.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So if he wasn’t that big YouTube star, and you just saw him as a boxing contender, you’d be like, ‘That dude’s got dynamite in his hands.’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paul knocked out former UFC welterweight champion Tyron Woodley in the sixth round of their rematch last December, after winning a decision against “The Chosen One” in August – on what was Woodley’s professional boxing debut.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">UFC: Oliveira weigh-in controversy erupts, Gaethje blasts ‘excuses’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That win followed up another high-profile victory against a renowned MMA fighter – a first-round knockout of former UFC star Ben Askren, a welterweight champion in Bellator and ONE Championship.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Jake Paul can crack – 100 per cent,” Rogan added. “That knockout of Tyron Woodley is legit. We would’ve gotten some answers if Tommy Fury didn’t get injured leading up to that fight, because he was the initial opponent. That would be a real interesting fight.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Consider it from this perspective. If Jake Paul wasn’t this YouTube guy, if he was just a boxer – if you see a boxer knock out the former UFC welterweight champion, one of the best ever, knock him out with one punch like that … ‘Oh man, have you seen this Jake Paul dude coming up? He’s for real.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/07/b966b3c5-ed40-428a-bffe-ed7a263ed5e2_da437bf9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paul added the role of successful boxing promoter to his resume last weekend, after selling out Madison Square Garden along with Eddie Hearn for Katie Taylor’s title defence against Amanda Serrano.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also got into some heated debates with Hearn in the build-up to the fight, with the English promoter questioning his ceiling in professional boxing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The kid’s got hustle,” Rogan said of Paul. “You’ve got to give it to him. He’s a legitimate businessman but he makes so much money doing other [expletive]. The fact he wants to promote fights as well, I’m impressed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The conversation he had with Eddie Hearn, where he said, ‘I will knock out any one of your guys that has under 10 fights, whoever you wanna have.’ You can see Eddie Hearn like, ‘[expletive]’. He’s kinda stuck there, because those guys with under 10 fights, what if Jake Paul knocks one of them out?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What if you get a guy that hasn’t been tested, maybe has some promise, and maybe gets wrapped up in the hype? Maybe gets a little nervous, because it’s his first chance at a big, big show.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mm6eonruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH2Wb29yaV%2BfvKZ50aiemqZdqK66v4yjmKSdXaWutriMq5yapF2XvLmx0WafnmWTlrtur9GamqRlYWV9bq%2FEp6s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./its-a-wonderful-lifes-child-stars-share-filming-memories.html><span>←</span><span>It's a Wonderful Life's Child Stars Share Filming Memories</span></a>

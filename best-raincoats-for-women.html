Maybe it’s earth’s way of cleansing the old and cleaning the streets for the new — polishing cobblestone roads for leaves to fall onto, cleaning the air for snowflakes to float, and overturning the soil for flowers to grow. While we praise the sunny days, we’re grateful for the rainy ones for bringing life to all the nature we love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Poetics aside, business still needs to run as usual, which means you need to head to the grocery store, pick up the kids, and even go running — rain or shine. And as much as you love to watch the rain fall from the safety of your reading nook, you don’t want it soiling through your clothes as you check through your to-do list. Umbrellas can be useful, but they’re not as practical, especially for fashion and celebrity stylist Bronagh Meere. “Since having children I’m all about the raincoat,” she says. “It’s very tricky to hold an umbrella when you're pushing a pram or holding a little hand.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Which is why we spent dozens of hours putting countless rain jackets and coats to the test to see which outperformed the rest. And when we say “put to the test," we literally stood under a shower and observed how the droplets rolled off, inspected if any water made its way through to the interior, and took note of any additional perks (like extended hoodies or cinched in waists). We then picked the winning jackets and wrote about our personal experiences to bring you the best rain jackets to shop right now.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-all-around-best-one-to-buy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The All-Around Best One To Buy</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Helly Hansen Women’s Long Belfast Jacket on <a href=#>Helly Hansen</a></span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Helly Hansen</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For everyday activities, this option from Helly Hansen proved its superior functionality to us. With a <strong>longer hem</strong> that covered the backside, the design offered more protection than a standard jacket. The material was also <strong>completely waterproof</strong>, and with the hood up and zipper fastened up to our chins, our entire neck, hair, and faces were properly protected as well.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-two-more-top-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Two More Top Picks</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Outdoor Research Women's Aspire Super Stretch Jacket on <a href=#>Outdoor Research</a></span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This option is ideal for the runner, who expects to be protected from the rain while having access to their full range of motion. The jacket offers <strong>four-way stretch panels</strong> to increase mobility and has zippered vents for additional <strong>breathability</strong>. The <strong>lightweight</strong> jacket did not feel restrictive as we did any rigorous exercises in it.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Rains Long Jacket on <a href=#>Rains</a></span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rains</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This jacket is for the <strong>stylish city-goer</strong>, the one who doesn’t want to compromise looks for functionality. Instead of the crinkly texture of traditional raincoats, this one has a <strong>sleek, durable, muted texture</strong> instead. It’s also our longest option on the list, covering everything down to the knees.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-helly-hansen-womens-long-belfast-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Helly Hansen Long Belfast Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Helly Hansen Women's Long Belfast Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/x9jawq36ocwE0g6SuLMYK-AsMcc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/helly-hansen-womens-long-belfast-jacket-14d17198e47242ef83a7a16c0e189c14.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Helly Hansen</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Breathability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Even the zippers are lined with a waterproof material.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not very breathable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our best overall pick is synonymous with a best everyday rain jacket, since it’s stylish, long, and <strong>completely waterproof</strong>. We picked this option because we’re most likely going to wear it any day it rains for simple activities. The long hem covered our backside properly and the zip came all the way up to our chins, allowing us to almost perfectly cover our heads with the hood up and fastened.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were also blown away by the quality — there’s no doubt in our minds that this would last well over a decade. When we placed water droplets on the jacket, it was almost as if hitting glass — <strong>completely impermeable.</strong> There are only three exterior zipped pockets and no inside pockets, which we felt was a missed opportunity. Still, all the zippers had waterproof lining as well, ensuring nothing would seep through. While this makes it perfect for strolls through the city and running errands in town, it’s not the best raincoat for sports. Its breathability was close to zero, so it got pretty hot when we did some jumping jacks in it.

This jacket excelled in four key points. First, the hood with its <strong>adjustable drawstrings</strong> covered our entire head and foreheads, so much so that it could be pouring rain and the water would just slide right off the hood and never touch our face, hair, or neck.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Second, there are <strong>zippered armpit vents</strong> keeping things breathable and cool on the interior. This became especially handy when we were hiking up a mountain. The jacket is so <strong>lightweight</strong> and mobile, we had no issues doing jumping jacks in it without it restricting our movements.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thirdly, there are adjustable cinches on the wrists, hem, hood, and waist. Basically, any place where water could potentially creep in can be amply blocked out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And lastly,<strong> it’s packable!</strong> Yes, it comes with a little pouch that we could easily roll the jacket into, making it perfect for travel. Not even travel, but should the rain stop midday, we feel happy knowing we could store it in our purse without soiling the rest of our items. Considering how functional this jacket is, we just wish it came in more colors, especially some basic tones like black.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester<strong> | Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Size: </strong>XS–XL <strong>|&nbsp;Length: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-columbia-womens-switchback-iii-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Columbia Switchback Iii Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Columbia Women's Switchback III Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3aDL5rp0bqwZ4m3oESZq6_kwiIU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/columbia-womens-switchback-iii-jacket-f57c10f4ba13440887c63ef41abcde5e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s extremely lightweight and easy to pack.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish it was longer in the back for extra coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Considering it’s not an item you wear on a daily, we can totally understand the hesitation of spending a ton of money on a rain jacket. This option, despite its affordable price point, exceeded our expectations in how well it protected us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The looser fit gave us access to our <strong>full range of motion</strong>, allowing us to do jumping jacks without it pulling against our chests. While exercising, the lightweight <strong>jacket felt breathable</strong>, saving us from feeling stuffy or overheated. There’s only one layer to it, and the lack of inner linings made it all the more light, easy to fold, and <strong>pack up for travel.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The jacket was also perfectly <strong>leak-proof</strong> — all it took was one shake and every droplet came right off the surface. Even items in the mesh pockets were properly protected. The only thing we wish we could change was the length — a little extra coverage around the bum would be nice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester, nylon<strong> | Colors: </strong>10+<strong> | Size: </strong>XS–3XL<strong> |&nbsp;Length: </strong>Standard</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Standing under a shower wearing a rain jacket with the hood up" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6CnSGAbgJp-reCAx7An_7bdkClw=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-rain-jackets-test-columbia-switchback-iii-jkim-0906-4ce80ab23fba4ea28bf5702bd4a92a34.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>InStyle/Joy Kim</span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Standing under a shower in a raincoat" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sd89PuQxP_rrT4wcNKkEvxhEyWM=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-rain-jackets-test-columbia-switchback-iii-jkim-0901-d23b7068dfc542e3992b768bf26d0d68.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>InStyle/Joy Kim</span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-lands-end-womens-plus-size-waterproof-hooded-packable-raincoat></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lands’ End Women's Plus Size Waterproof Hooded Packable Raincoat</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lands' End Women's Waterproof Hooded Packable Raincoat" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4GFmtbVeq6a5sg0Nj4OF_D0L3H0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lands-end-womens-waterproof-hooded-packable-raincoat--f96afee3d59f42ee9aac6dee64f4abb2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Breathability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s <strong>well insulated</strong>, keeping us warm through cold weather.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish the hoodie was a little larger so it could go past our foreheads.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lands’ End products never skimp out on <strong>quality</strong>, and that’s very evident with this raincoat. We placed a tissue in the interior and then dosed water on the jacket, but the tissue came out untouched and dry. While wearing the coat, we were impressed with just how <strong>lightweight</strong> it felt, despite the <strong>substantial material</strong>. We had no issues moving around freely and felt amply protected by the longer hem and hoodie — although we will say, the hood did not go past our hairline, so some droplets reached our faces. Thanks to the <strong>drawstrings</strong> around the waist, the jacket allowed us to define our shape and adjust for snugness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also noticed how <strong>well-insulated</strong> the jacket was. We would feel comfortable wearing this in cold weather knowing that our bodies will stay warm and dry. Conversely, it’s not the most breathable jacket.

The second is that when they are wet, we want to keep them from soiling the other items we’re throwing them together with. Luckily, this option comes with a little pouch to hide the jacket in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No rain or mist reached our skins while wearing this jacket, thanks to its <strong>waterproof exterior.</strong> As we jumped and hopped around, we didn’t even break a sweat due to how <strong>lightweight and breathable</strong> the material was. It gave us access to our full range of motion, so much so that we would feel comfortable wearing this out on a run. It even comes with a <strong>ventilation zip</strong> under the armpits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The jacket has three pockets, two on the exterior and one hidden inside — all of which have a waterproof lining on the zipper as well. Although we noticed the zippers didn’t have the smoothest of glides. If not positioned correctly, they got caught in their own ridges. When we were ready to store the jacket away, the <strong>structurally flexible material</strong> was easy to roll up and place in the provided pouch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester<strong> | Colors: </strong>14 <strong>| Size: </strong>XS–XXL<strong> |&nbsp;Length: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-little-donkey-andy-womens-waterproof-rain-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lightweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Little Donkey Andy Waterproof Rain Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Little Donkey Andy Women's Waterproof Rain Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9PFyZl58e1cULsnVkxRJkFOkXI4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/little-donkey-andy-womens-waterproof-rain-jacket-7ef0740ad7c84552b937e95665520e7b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Breathability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s extremely easy to pack and bring along to just about anywhere.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s very form-fitted, so if you want to layer sweaters underneath, we recommend sizing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are a number of reasons why you should opt for a lightweight rain jacket, the biggest and most important reason being that it’s <strong>easier to pack and bring along on trips.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The jacket has no venting or mesh lining to make it feel breathable, but because its <strong>single layer makes it so lightweight,</strong> it didn’t feel like we were overheating in it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This one was bullet-proof to any and all moisture.

We loved how the <strong>zippers were waterproofed</strong> as well, ensuring anything in our pockets would be completely safe as well.

The chest area is cut a little larger, subtly following our curves and making it easier to move around in it without feeling pressed against the fabric. For additional space and ventilation, we could even <strong>unzip the armpits</strong>. Although we do have to say, sometimes the zipper got stuck for no reason, making it less than a smooth experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like all the other jackets we’ve included in this list, the material absorbed none of the water we splashed on it.

Even as we let the water shower on this sturdy jacket,<strong> droplets slid right off </strong>as if they hit solid glass. It’s <strong>double-layered</strong> and the material is very strong. We trust it to keep us warm during said downpour. Meere emphasizes the importance of a <strong>large hood </strong>capable of covering all your hair, and this one does just that. It’s very protective, coming all the way over our foreheads and then tightening with its adjustable straps. We completely covered our noggins safely. Additionally, <strong>velcro cuffs and adjustable drawstrings </strong>on the hem along with the hoodie made water completely inaccessible to the interior.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Should the weather lighten up, however, we could open the zips on each side of the jacket to get some airflow going. Despite its strong makeup, it’s still impressively lightweight, so it didn’t weigh down on us at any given point. While it did offer some coverage to our backside, we wish the jacket was longer for even better protection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester <strong>| Colors: </strong>6<strong> | Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> |&nbsp;Length: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-working-out-outdoor-research-womens-aspire-super-stretch-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Working Out</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Outdoor Research Aspire Super Stretch Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Outdoor Research Women's Aspire Super Stretch Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GqXClF3_prDqxFr-ODddu1f05q4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/outdoor-research-womens-aspire-super-stretch-jacket-a0ceeb02b05b40b7ac3d88eb1231c081.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Breathability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The four-way stretch panels increase mobility.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish there were more universal colors like black and gray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those who like to run in the rain will need more than just a waterproof jacket, but a breathable one as well — no one wants to get overheated by their own body heat. We found this jacket to be extremely lightweight, made of high-quality <strong>four-way stretch panels</strong> for superior mobility. Unlike the previous Outdoor Research jacket we discussed, this one comes with the added benefit of being somewhat stretchy and easy to move around in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">InStyle’s Senior Beauty Editor Shannon Bauer, who also happens to be a marathon runner, emphasizes the importance of <strong>zippered venting</strong> under the arms to avoid overheating, which this jacket has. The large hood can also be tied around the face, making it not only block rain out but stay in place as we jump around. Overall, the jacket is thin, breathable, movement-friendly, and durable. As a great all-around jacket, we wonder why it’s not offered in a more standard color like black.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Nylon, polyester<strong> | Colors: </strong>3<strong> | Size: </strong>XS–XXL<strong> |&nbsp;Length: </strong>Standard</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-rains-womens-long-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rains Long Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rains Long Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sA7EGvBdMEcZO8_LiJIG-boe9yU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rains-long-jacket-84af16e7f1d8421ab0357aa7a4668d5c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rains</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Breathability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The length<strong> </strong>protects our legs and backside as well.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Heavy-duty rain can seep through the buttons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for something a little more <strong>stylish</strong>, then we recommend this long coat from Rains. It’s different from the others as it doesn’t have the same crinkly texture that rain jackets are well known for. Instead, it has a <strong>very sleek, soft, and muted</strong> feel to it, despite being an impressively <strong>heavy-duty jacket</strong>. It’s the kind of coat you could easily style up and still look chic, rather than looking like you just came trekking down a mountain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another interestingly different detail about this jacket is that <strong>it’s a button-down</strong>, rather than a zip-up. When we stood under a shower with it, some water did seep through the open space between each button. That being said, showers have a very targeted downpour — we’re confident that some simple rain in the city would be harmless. It’s also one of the few longer options we tried, and it protected our legs along with our upper bodies as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester, polyurethane<strong> | Colors: </strong>10<strong> | Size: </strong>XS–XXL <strong>|&nbsp;Length: </strong>Long</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cinched-waist-khl-womens-stretch-voyager-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cinched Waist</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kühl Women's Stretch Voyager Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kuhl Women's Stretch Voyager Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mVENseI_Cvi84C22VTamDCoN6os=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kuhl-stretch-voyagr-jacket-66aa38a00c954b02969e4fdb5d125a3d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kuhl</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Breathability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The design lets you adjust the waist and covers the butt properly as well.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not the most breathable option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rain jackets shouldn’t look like you’re wearing a large plastic garbage bag, and Kühl agrees. The little bit of <strong>cinching around the waist</strong> made us feel elegant and put together despite the rain. Since it’s adjustable, we were able to customize the hourglass look as well. The jacket is also a little longer than a standard length, covering the backside properly. The sleeves were long and the<strong> hood was large,</strong> making it easy to fully hide our bodies from the storm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">An important feature to note was how stretchy the jacket was.

From there, we pulled 23 rain options into our testing site and vetted them rigorously. Each jacket had to be worn under our <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">portable showers</a>, dosed with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">watering cans</a>, and misted with spray bottles. We observed whether or not any droplets were absorbed into the surface, or if they rolled right off. By placing tissues inside the jacket, we took note of whether or not the interior got wet during these tests. We also evaluated how the jacket felt on — by doing jumping jacks, we tested our range of motion, whether we heated up immediately or whether there was some ventilation to keep us cool. Lastly, we measured how long it took for the jackets to completely dry off.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material & Features</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most raincoats come in weather-treated cotton, nylon, or polyester. “DWR” is an acronym you’ll see often, meaning durable water repellent. Different base fabrics, like polyester and nylon, can be treated with a DWR coating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of features, it depends on your personal needs. Sr. Designer at Eddie Bauer, Tasha Tennant recommends looking for “internal secure chest pockets for stashing a credit card, protective hoods, and dual entry hand pockets, which are made with a top entry and side entry providing extra room for stashing your phone and&nbsp;AirPods.” Bonus points go to the jackets that have waterproof lining on the zippers as well, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Little Donkey Andy Women’s Waterproof Rain Jacket</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Helly Hansen Women’s Long Belfast Jacket</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, UK-based influencer Daisy Ashcrot, who says she buys a rain coat at least once or twice a year, looks for a rain jacket that is “lightweight but also has some element of responsive heat technology to keep me cool in the light summer rain and warm in the late fall.” Take any of the jackets with added venting, if you want to follow Ashcroft’s (rainboot) footprints, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Outdoor Research Women's Aspire Super Stretch Jacket</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Karitraa Voss Jacket</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Length</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ll see that we mentioned several jackets alongside some coats in this story. Jackets come down around your hips, while coats go past your butt and sometimes even down to your thighs. Naturally, the longer versions will provide a little extra coverage from the rain. Take the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Rains Long Jacket</a> for example.

As a new mom who’s always running around, Ashcroft pairs her coat with “some jeans, gorgeous <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>rain boots</a>, and a sleek zipped bag to ensure the whole ensemble looks effortlessly chic.” To add a little to the figure, she continues that “a belt or a cinched waist can elevate the look, especially with longer hem trench coats.” Those that can relate will enjoy the ease and coverage of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kühl Stretch Voyager Jacket</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Bauer takes her well-ventilated rain jacket on runs and needs something short, lightweight, and breathable.

Labels such as “water resistant,” “water repellent,” and “waterproof” all offer different layers of protection. Tennant breaks down these descriptors for us:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Water Resistant:</strong> “Water-resistant outerwear is made with tightly constructed woven fabrics,” says Tennant. While the tight knit itself can block some of the light rain, it’s not completely fool-proof against the moisture.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Water Repellent: </strong>This is the technology you’ll most commonly see when shopping for rain jackets. “Water-repellent outerwear is made with materials treated with DWR coatings,” explains Tennant. “The coatings make water bead up on the surface of the fabric, making it difficult for rain to penetrate the jacket during rain showers.”&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Waterproof: </strong>Waterproof is the term you should look for if you plan on getting caught in an actual downpour, whether you walk to work or partake in high alpine hiking.&nbsp;“Waterproof products are made with layered fabrics which have hydrophilic properties that wick moisture away from the body on the inside and repel water on the outside,” says Tennant. “Waterproof jackets are also designed with sealed seams which add another layer of protection by keeping water out at the seams of the jacket.” The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lands’ End Women's Plus Size Waterproof Hooded Packable Raincoat, </a><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Little Donkey Andy Women’s Waterproof Rain Jacket</a>, and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">MARMOT Women's Precip Waterproof Rain Jacket</a> all provide guaranteed waterproofing, which offers superior protection in heavy rain.</li></ul><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you wash a raincoat?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though some products require specific care and you should always read the instructions on the website or clothing label, here are a few general rules of thumb from a technical designer. “Machine wash cold, delicate, and separate, use mild detergent. Rinse thoroughly and tumble dry low for best results,” explains Tennant. “You shouldn’t iron or steam, dry clean, bleach, or use fabric softeners on a raincoat.” Or if you want to keep things simple, Ashcroft occasionally takes hers to the dry cleaners to freshen the inside and then handwashes the exterior at home.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a> is a commerce writer with three years of experience covering fashion and beauty.

He released his second solo mixtape, D-2, in 2020. In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a> in 2021, Suga opened up about what inspires his lyrics. “I’m comfortable now and feeling good, but those sorts of negative emotions come and go. So it’s almost like cold weather. It may come back in a cycle over a year, year and a half,” he said. “But when I hear people say that when they listen to my music, and feel comfort and are consoled by those lyrics that express these emotions, that makes me feel very good. It’s very encouraging. I think, for anybody, these emotions are not something that need to be hidden. They need to be discussed and expressed. Whatever emotions that I may be feeling, I’m always ready to express them now, as I was before.</p><p>He also told Rolling Stone about how his songwriting process is different when he writes for himself and BTS versus other artists. “The process is really different for every song. Sometimes it may be a word that pops up and I build on that word, or someone could make a request for a certain way they would like a song to be developed,” he said. “Oftentimes, we decide on a theme and then we sort of freely work from the larger overarching theme that we may have. But generally, when I work on a song, I create the beat first and then the melody and the rap and then finally the lyrics. That’s generally how I build them.”</p><p>In February 2023, Suga announced his first solo tour, the Agust D Tour, which will run from April 2023 to June 2023 and will span the United States, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.

I was thinking a lot recently that maybe I should shoot two music videos: one just there for the visuals, while the other is more focused on the listening experience. Ah, what should I do? I’m working hard on a follow-up to D-2,” he said.</p><p>He also told the magazine about how he’s grown as both a producer and rapper for BTS since the K-pop group’s debut in 2013. “Fortunately. Lately I’ve been thinking about how I don’t know what kind of music I should do when I get older, and that maybe I should try a few different styles now,” he said. “I think this is both a blessing and a curse, but I think that, while I’m able to work in various genres, I’m not sure any of them are that deep. That’s why I try to use many different styles and when I’m promoting my own material, I put in a lot of things I like, like surprises and twists. These days I started to want to do things again, too. And that brings me both worry and excitement.”</p><p>When asked what he wants ARMYs to feel when listening to his music, Suga told Weverse Magazine, “I used to place a lot of importance on music—especially when I was young—but now I’m trying hard not to place too much meaning on it. It’s just the times we live in, for one thing, because at some point we became a generation for whom music is simply background music.”</p><p>He continued, “I’m not saying that’s a bad thing. It’s a natural progression, and anyway, I thought there’s a difference between when a musician knows why they’re doing music or not. Here’s what I think: People who listen to my music—I mean, to a certain extent, I think being a fan of something is a must in life. You could be a fan of a person or a sport—whatever it’s about, I think being a fan is important because it makes life fun. Like feeling excited for the NBA playoffs as soon as you open your eyes in the morning. Some people are going to be excited for the day my music comes out and for me to perform. There aren’t a lot of things to be excited for in life. But for anyone who likes my music, I hope they’re excited for it—excited for when it comes out, excited for when I promote and excited for when I go on tour. I hope they’re excited for everything so I can give their life meaning each and every day.”</p><p><span class=s1>Suga tickets to the Agust D Tour are available on <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>StubHub</span></a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Vivid Seats</span></a>.

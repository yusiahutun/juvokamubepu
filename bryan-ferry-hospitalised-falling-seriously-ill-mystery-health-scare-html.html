 Pop legend Bryan Ferry was last night undergoing hospital tests after falling seriously ill.
Doctors were called for the star after he was taken ill in London, the Daily Mail has learned. As a result, the 65-year-old – who splits his time between a townhouse in Chelsea, South West London, and a country house in West Sussex - was forced to cancel an appearance at an Olympics 2012 event last night."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

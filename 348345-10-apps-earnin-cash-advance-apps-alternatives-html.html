The beauty of Earnin is, there is no fee or interest charge but you can choose what you want to pay to support the service. Earnin offers several features which include:</p><ul><li>The Balance Shield: This safeguards you from substantial bank overdraft fees and helps you keep track of your bank balance. It also alerts you if your balance drops below a specific amount.</li><li>Cashback Rewards: The Earnin app also acts as a shopping reward app. You only need to link your credit or debit card to your Earnin account. If you opt to run it as a credit card when paying, you will be eligible to earn rewards of 1% to 10% cash back at your local stores or restaurants.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f562fa7c77dcea39.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 legit apps to earn money for Android and iOS smartphones</span></p></a><p class=align-left>More benefits from Earnin include secure access to the app since the company will not store your personal details, safety of your data through rigorous data encryption, and total compliance with strict US privacy and security laws.</p><h2>10 cash advance apps like Earnin</h2><p class=align-left>There are other apps like Earnin that offer relief during a financial crunch. Here are some of the ten best cash advance apps alternatives for you:</p><h3>1. Dave</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f562fa7c77dcea39.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dave</a> is like the financial version of David vs. Goliath and it is one of the best cash advance apps like Earnin Reddit. It combines some key features from both Earnin and Chime. And unlike most payday loan alternatives, Dave does not have a minimum balance and a no-interest cash advance. With most financial institutions, if you make a payment that is more than the amount you have in your account, the institution pays out the cash and then hits you with an inflexible fee.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5df46aeaa1473518.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best cash advance apps like Dave for instant loans in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Dave, however, notifies you when you are at risk of going overbalance and provides an option of requesting an advance of up to $100 from your next paycheck, making it the best choice if you are struggling to stick to a budget. There are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">no credit checks</a> needed with Dave, and unlike most payday advance apps, it has a low membership fee of 1%.</p><p class=align-left>Like the Earnin app, Dave has other features which include:</p><ul><li>The freedom to freeze and unfreeze your card through the app</li><li>Automatic budgeting that's dependent on your monthly expenses</li><li>The fantastic Side Hustle feature that connects you with money-making gigs in your locality</li></ul><h3>2. Chime</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7acedf4fe03a0b08.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chime</a>, one of the most flexible cash advance apps like Dave, does not provide paycheck advances in the same manner as Brigit and Earnin. Instead, the online bank account offers access to your pay faster.</p><p class=align-left>With most financial institutions, you have to wait two to three days to access your pay. With Chime, if you have the direct deposit account, you will access your funds the moment your employer deposits into the account.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c471adc95b1c2df.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 car logbook loan providers in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Chime has other features that most financial institutions don't. They include:</p><ul><li>Automatic Savings: Chime provides you with a competitive high-yield savings account. With the automatic savings Round-Up feature enabled, Chime helps by rounding up each purchase on your debit card to the nearest dollar and credit the difference into your savings account.</li><li>Payment App Feature: Pay Friends, the latest app feature, allows you to transfer funds to your friends and family who also have Chime spending accounts. The app imports your contacts, making it easy to carry out the transfer. There is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">no service fee charged</a>.</li></ul><h3>3. MoneyLion</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5df46aeaa1473518.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">MoneyLion</a> is an all-round personal finance app that goes far beyond Earnin by offering a no-fee checking account, and 0% APR cash advances.</p><p class=align-left>It is one of the most dependable apps like Dave overdraft and features a 24/7 Instacash feature that allows you to borrow up to $250 of your next paycheck with no credit checks or interest.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f6fec6ad1bf33f2a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to open and verify your Skrill account</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It has two levels of membership and the free Core Membership features:</p><ul><li>Zero-Fee Managed Investing: The checking account allows you to transfer money from your savings account into a portfolio of exchange-traded funds tailored to fit your risk tolerance.

SpeedyCash</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/80e1dfa85897fc96.png><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SpeedyCash</a> is one of the best cash advance apps with no credit checks. It was initially developed to help borrowers manage their short-term loans. With time, it has grown to be one of the best apps like Earnin for Chime, and in addition to providing you with an advance on your next paycheck, the online money app deals with auto title loans, installment loans and lines of credit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e20891c7edb9a4c6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Hazina Sacco, dividends, loan application, branches, contacts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unlike other cash advance apps like Earnin, SpeedyCash stays true to its name by offering fast payday advances.</p><h3>5.

If you would like to be a Plus member and access Instapay, you have to work for an employer that provides it as a benefit.

It also allows you to set up automated advances that enable you to collect a transfer anytime your account balance is at risk of dropping below zero to avoid hefty bank overdraft fees.</p><p class=align-left>However, unlike other apps like Earnin, Brigit has specific requirements which include:</p><ul><li>Income: You have to prove that your monthly pay is above a certain amount, which they do not specify on the site.

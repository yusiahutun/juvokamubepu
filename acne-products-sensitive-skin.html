These two chemical exfoliants are often recommended by dermatologists because they are scientifically proven to kill acne-causing bacteria beneath the skin.

For some, the popular acne-fighting ingredients may be too harsh or conflict with other skincare products applied (such as those containing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>retinol</a>). So how about considering alternative acne treatments?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, learn more about four under-the-radar ingredients used to treat breakouts, according to top dermatologists.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-succinic-acid></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Succinic Acid</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This buzzy ingredient is derived from amber or sugar cane through a fermentation process. It helps control excess sebum and shine, which can potentially lead to breakouts. However, Dr. Jeanine Downie, board-certified dermatologist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Image Dermatology</a>, says while succinic acid can decrease oil levels, it can be drying and isn't as potent as salicylic acid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With that in mind, succinic acid can give a product a boost when formulated in conjunction with salicylic acid and other ingredients tailored to acne-prone skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Inkey List Succinic Acid Acne Treatment</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to succinic acid, this spot treatment contains salicylic acid and sulfur (more on that ingredient in a sec) to treat blemishes and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>blackheads</a>. Hyaluronic acid provides a bit of hydration to prevent dryness and flaking, so the treatment can be worn underneath makeup during the day. It's also gentle enough for sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As someone with sensitive skin, I found this treatment to be calming for the inflamed zit I had near the corner of my mouth without being overly drying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$10; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>theinkeylist.com</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Perricone MD Acne Relief Calming Treatment & Hydrator</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This lightweight serum can be used twice a day to help minimize inflammation, acne-exacerbating bacteria, and dryness. Along with succinic acid, niacinamide, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lactic acid</a>, squalane, and citrulline (a calming alpha-amino acid) are the hero ingredients of the treatment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$45; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>amazon.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sulfur></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sulfur</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Topical sulfur can be an effective treatment for acne," says Dr. Downie. "It is effective for some people because it is antibacterial." This means sulfur can reduce inflammation and bacteria growth that leads to breakouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While sulfur is safe for all skin types, Dr. Downie points out people with allergies to the ingredient should avoid using it as an acne treatment. Sensitive skin types may find sulfur too drying and irritating, especially when combined with benzoyl peroxide.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Kate Somerville EradiKate Acne Treatment</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate Somerville's spot treatment contains the highest level of sulfur allowed in a topical product.

"The exact mechanism of action of how zinc works in acne treatment is poorly understood but is thought to be associated with inflammatory pathways," says Dr. Shari Sperling, board-certified dermatologist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sperling Dermatology</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to acne treatments, zinc is also found in physical sunscreens (zinc oxide) and anti-dandruff shampoo (zinc pyrithione). If you want to incorporate zinc into your skincare routine, just proceed with caution because it can cause some sensitivity. To avoid any serious issues, Dr. Sperling recommends doing a patch test first. "You could have a topical reaction to zinc, so make sure you test an area of your skin prior to using to see if you are sensitive to it," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zinc can also be taken orally to treat acne. "Zinc is over the counter as zinc acetate, zinc gluconate, and zinc sulfate, and has different formulations, Dr. Sperling explains. "Zinc is also found in food such as beans and dairy products. You should always check with your physician to make sure you are taking the appropriate amount of zinc."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Sperling says zinc sulfate has been shown to be more effective with severe acne, but has been associated with side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, so keep that in mind when considering zinc supplements as a treatment option.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Glossier Super Pure Niacinamide + Zinc Serum</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Glossier created its Super Pure serum for skin that tends to get dried out or irritated from the typical acne treatments.

Comedoclastin comes from milk thistle and has been discovered to have pimple and oil-reducing properties.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a great ingredient because it does play nice with other active ingredients and does not cause any irritation or concern when using with other products," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Mona Gohara</a>, board-certified dermatologist and associate clinical professor of dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The brand's clinical studies show that comedoclastin can improve the appearance of acne in just a week. "Significant changes can be seen in clearing acne spots from just seven days of use," Dr. Gohara shares. "It visibly reduces blemishes up to 22% from seven days and up to 39% in two months when observed under dermatological control."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Avène Cleanance Concentrate Blemish Control Serum</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Avène's serum can be used on all types of acne at every stage, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hormonal cysts</a>, and is also soothing, thanks to the addition of the brand's thermal spring water. Because the serum has a water-gel texture, a little goes a long way. I've been using it every night for over a month and still haven't hit the bottom. The fact that the comedoclastin plays nice with all other ingredients makes it a no-brainer to try. I don't have to think about alternating my other actives like retinol to treat my hormonal breakouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$28; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>dermstore.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1omJymlWK9s7vDrpqtq12osq%2B%2FyK2gr51dqLiqug%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-find-bella-hadids-naked-pants.html><span>←</span><span>Opinion | Where to find Bella Hadids naked pants</span></a>

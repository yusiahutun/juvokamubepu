He took a 13-year-old Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior into his Under 15 side, weaned him off junk food, put him on a special weights programme, turned him from a pure striker into a playmaker and taught him to use his left foot.<br></span></p><p><span>‘I sent him a message on Facebook after the Croatia game,’ he says. ‘I said: “See? It’s good to score with your left!”’</span></p><p><span>During a career that spanned almost 700 games for Santos, Lima was known as the ‘lung’ of the team and ‘O Curinga’; the joker in the pack.</span></p><p><span>He was a defender, but he was also expected to be as comfortable on one foot as the other. Such skill is part of the DNA of this club, as the words on one exhibit in the museum illustrate. ‘At a time when toe-kicking was something to be ashamed of, our defenders were as brilliant as our strikers, who used to drive the fans into a frenzy with their dribbling skills and stunning goals.’</span></p><p><span>The museum is a shrine to all the great Santos players and to the 12,054 goals they have scored; they keep a running total on a digital scoreboard. But it is to Pele and Neymar that most of the attention is devoted. To these two sons of Santos who face one another in the form of two stunning sculptures that provide the centrepiece to the museum.</span></p><img id=i-acae4ee82297d959 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/16/article-2659244-1ED1268600000578-26_634x456.jpg height=456 width=634 alt="Sons of Santos: Pele embraces Neymar during the club's 100th anniversary celebrations in 2012" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sons of Santos: Pele embraces Neymar during the club's 100th anniversary celebrations in 2012</p><h2><span>I sent Neymar a message after the Croatia game and said, 'See? It's good to score with your left'</span></h2><p><span>Nobody scored more goals for Santos than Pele - a quite staggering 1091 in 18 years - and in Lima’s opinion it is wrong to even try to compare Neymar, indeed any player, to his great friend.</span></p><p><span>‘‘No, no,’ says Lima. ‘You can’t compare any player with Pele, because you will never find another one like Pele.’ And in the museum Lima’s view is supported by a stunning photograph of Pele that is accompanied by a quote from a Brazilian sports writer. ‘There goes Pele with the ball that God gave him.’</span></p><p><span>One wonders if there is too much Neymar. There are so many other former Santos players, World Cup winners among them, who should be commanding more attention than a 22-year-old who, to date, has done relatively little. Even if he did reach 30 international goals faster than Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.</span></p><p><span>But Antonio Lima Dos Santos, this charming, smiling 72-year-old, goes so far as to suggest that Neymar can unite the people of Brazil with the beauty of his football. ‘He has the power to move people,’ he says, before arguing that those angry about the sheer expense of hosting the World Cup should save their protests for nearer the Brazil election later this year.<br></span></p><img id=i-65c0b67fae96cc5b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/16/article-2659244-1ED14AAC00000578-357_634x399.jpg height=399 width=634 alt="Neymar very junior: The future Brazil superstar pictured in 2000, aged eight" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Neymar very junior: The future Brazil superstar pictured in 2000, aged eight</p><img id=i-64a5f36a9136bdf9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/16/article-2659244-1ED1453B00000578-981_634x390.jpg height=390 width=634 alt="Future hairo: A shaven-headed Neymar protectively holds a ball while a junior at Santos" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Future hairo: A shaven-headed Neymar protectively holds a ball while a junior at Santos</p><h3 class=wocc><b>BRAZIL'S GOALDEN BOYS</b><br></h3><p><span>Pele and Neymar's scoring records for Brazil</span></p><p><b><span>Pele</span></b></p><p><span>92 caps, 77 goals (1957-1971)<br></span></p><p><b><span>Neymar</span></b></p><p><span>50 caps, 33 goals (2010-)<br></span></p><p><span>After pausing for thought, Lima does acknowledge that certain comparisons can be made with Pele. ‘In terms of attitude, they are the same,’ he says. ‘Neymar also has something that even Pele doesn’t. The speed of his feet and the way he can move the ball. Very fast.</span></p><p><span>‘The vision of the game, too, you can compare them. But the attitude is the thing that is most similar.</span></p><p><span>‘It frustrates me that Neymar plays on the left side for Brazil. No, let the boy play! Don’t hold him to a position.&nbsp; Neymar can play everywhere. When you put him just in one position you make it better for the opposition.’</span></p><p><span>Lima has so many fond memories of the Barcelona superstar who now shoulders the burden of Brazil’s World Cup ambitions.</span></p><p><span>He was actually discovered by another Santos legend, Zito - nicknamed O Gerente – playing in a futsal tournament at 11-years-old. ‘In Brazil all kids start to play futsal before football,’ explains Luis Fernando Paes de Barros, who is another youth coach at Santos.<br></span></p><img id=i-115e186991bc951a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/16/article-2659244-1ED13EA200000578-680_306x471.jpg height=471 width=306 alt="Thin on the ground: A skinny Neymar playing for Santos in 2009, when they already knew he could be a star" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-11296b2ed3f2f5ac src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/16/article-2659244-1ED1361200000578-811_306x471.jpg height=471 width=306 alt="Slim pickings: A scrawny Neymar for Santos" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Thin on the ground: A skinny Neymar playing for Santos in 2009, when they already knew he could be a star</p><p><span>‘Until the age of 15 they play both. They benefit from playing on the smaller pitch indoors, in smaller teams; the size, the ball and also some technical aspects are different. We keep the futsal environment on the big field, working on the fast decision making, the movement without the ball, the tempo.</span></p><p><span>‘It helps players a lot. It helped Neymar a lot. In a regular football training session one player touches the ball every five minutes. In a futsal training session, every 20 seconds.’</span></p><p><span>Zito could see immediately that this boy from Mogi da Cruzes, in Sao Paulo, was special. He was signed immediately, and given a ‘salary’ of 450 reals per month (£120).</span></p><p><span>That money would encourage Neymar’s family to move to Santos, a middle class coastal city some 90 minutes-drive from the hustle and bustle of Sao Paulo with the largest beach garden in the world, as well as the largest port in Latin America.<br></span></p><p><span>Lima remembers a 13-year-old who would catch the bus to training from his parents’ home some 10 minutes from the stadium, and would hang out at the beach with his friends and eat ‘junk’.<br></span></p><img id=i-574470370f2aa3bf src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/16/article-2659244-1ED1094C00000578-50_634x538.jpg height=538 width=634 alt="Friends and colleagues: Antônio Lima dos Santos with his best mate Pele, playing for Santos in 1963" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Friends and colleagues: Antônio Lima dos Santos with his best mate Pele, playing for Santos in 1963</p><p><span>As Neymar rose through the ranks at Santos the coaching staff would worry he lacked the strength and stature to cope with the physical demands of the senior game. But it was not just a case of building him up with a weights programme, says Lima. They also needed to educate him to eat proper food before he could accumulate the seven or eight kilogrammes he needed as an adult footballer. &nbsp;</span></p><img id=i-e161542f9f450cca src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/16/article-2659244-0878B3F400000514-744_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Perfect 10: Neymar even wears the same iconic number as Pele for Brazil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Perfect 10: Neymar even wears the same iconic number as Pele for Brazil</p><p><span>‘His size was always an issue,’ says Lima. ‘He was really thin so we had to change the nutrition. A doctor, a nutritionist, in Sao Paulo helped. But he would eat a lot of junk food. Burgers. He would eat anything. And he would drink sodas. We changed all that.</span></p><p><span>‘When he was in the Under 15s we helped him and his team-mates to&nbsp; gain muscle. It certainly helped him.’</span></p><p><span>What also helped, says Lima, was his willingness to learn; to do whatever the coaches advised would make him a better footballer.<br></span></p><p><span>Lima says Neymar’s parents should take an enormous amount of credit for that. A traffic warden, his father demanded from Neymar and his sister that they understand the meaning of ‘respect’.</span></p><p><span>‘He always worked hard,’ says Lima. ‘If you said to Neymar he had to do this to become better, he would say “OK, I will do it”.</span></p><p><span>‘He was never a problem as a kid. When training had finished he was always the one who wanted to stay out and keep practising.’</span></p><p><span>It was early in Neymar’s development at Santos that Lima made what proved a hugely significant change. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>‘There was a game, around 2006, when I moved him back, more into the middle,’ says Lima. ‘He had always played as the striker and the team was losing 1-0 in this game against Sao Carlense.<br></span></p><h2><span>Neymar's size was always an issue... he was really thin so we had to change his nutrition</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>‘So I changed Neymar’s position and moved him deeper so he was more on the ball. We were losing 1-0 and Neymar made two goals and we won the game 4-1.</span></p><p><span>‘I’m not saying I was responsible for him being the player he is today but I played a part. That day changed everything.’</span></p><p><span>To begin with Neymar was not too keen on the idea. Lima made the point that as a centre forward, with his slight physique, he might struggle against bigger, stronger defenders. Neymar broke down in tears. ‘No, Profe,’ he pleaded. ‘You want to take me out of the area; you don’t want me to score?’ But Lima explained that he would see more of the ball and could be more influential.</span></p><p><span>‘At the same time I would make him practice all the time with his left foot,’ says Lima. ‘I was a defender but I would show him that if an opponent comes at you from one side it is much easier if you are comfortable on the other side. He would always ask me how he could be better and I would tell him to use his left foot.’<br></span></p><img id=i-9cd556e39b588881 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/16/article-2659244-09C91536000005DC-69_634x387.jpg height=387 width=634 alt="Raising the game: Pele won three World Cups - here he is being carried shoulder high in 1970" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Raising the game: Pele won three World Cups - here he is being carried shoulder high in 1970</p><h2><span>Until he moved to Barcelona, Neymar lived with his parents... and drove a Mini Cooper&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>For as long as he was at Santos, until last year when he made that move to Spain, he lived with his parents. And the car he would drive on the sun-drenched streets of Santos? ‘A Mini Cooper,’ declares Lima. ‘It was a beautiful car.’</span></p><p><span>Pele, he recalls, drove a Mercedes. ‘He won the Mercedes,’ he says. ‘But even then we were well paid. I had a Brazilian make of car but it was a good car. When I played in Mexico I drove a Ford Mustang.</span></p><p><span>‘Life was good in Santos though. Pele never left because nobody paid the money Santos wanted but he didn’t need to either.’</span></p><p><span>He and Pele roomed together for more than a decade.

It comes after fans of The Blind Side demanded Sandra Bullock be stripped of her Oscar for the critically-acclaimed film.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star, who played Michael Oher in the film, was left fuming with the reaction from viewers online. The demands follow the recent drama that has unfolded. The outcry over the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star’s Oscar stemmed from football star Oher filing a lawsuit against his adoptive family earlier this week. He claimed he never received any money from the proceeds of the film. He also alleged he was ‘forced’ into signing a conservatorship at age 18. The Tuhoy family have vehemently denied the claims.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-blind-side-fans-want-sandra-bullock-s-oscar>The Blind Side fans want Sandra Bullock’s Oscar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-566065063-1024x739.jpg><p>As the bombshell claims hit the press, fans of the NFL player were suggesting Sandra Bullock – who has scooped many gongs at <a href=#>Award Shows</a> – be asked to give her Oscar back. Bullock portrayed Oher’s adopted mom, Leigh Anne Tuohy, in the hit film.</p><p>The 2009 hit was critically and commercially successful, with viewers still watching the flick almost 15 years later. The drama, written and directed by John Lee Hancock, is based on the book of the same title, penned by Michael Lewis. It follows Michael Oher, a young teenager living in poverty and forcing to look after himself after a troubled upbringing. The Tuohy’s, Sean and Leigh Anne, welcome him into their home and raise him as their own.</p><p>The movie, with a <a href=#>celebrity</a> cast featuring Lily Collins, raked back more than 10 times the budget. It grossed more than $300 million despite its $29 million budget.</p><p>Bullock bagged several awards from her show-stopping performance as Leigh Anne. She took home an Academy Award, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award. The film itself received a nod under the Best Picture category at the Academy Awards.</p><p>The drama that has erupted from the lawsuit, filed in August 2023, has led to fans going for Bullock’s Oscar.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-brilliant-performance-shouldn-t-be-tarnished>‘Her brilliant performance shouldn’t be tarnished’</h2><p>Aaron, who portrayed Michael Oher, <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> TMZ that Sandra has nothing to do with the battle the family is undergoing right now.</p><p>He said: “To make a statement like that doesn’t make any sense.</p><p>“Sandra Bullock didn’t have anything to do with the real story that we’re reading as of right now.”</p><p>He added: “She gave a brilliant performance, and that shouldn’t be tarnished for something that had nothing to do with her.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-rush-in-to-defend-bullock>Fans rush in to defend Bullock</h2><p>As online backlash erupted, Sandra Bullock fans stepped in on <a href=#>Twitter</a> to defend her in the conversation.</p><p>One user wrote: “Sandra Bullock has proven time and again how good she is, and she just <a href=#>lost her partner to ALS</a>. She didn’t do anything other than play a role with information about the subjects that is now grossly different.”</p><p>Another echoed: “People want Sandra Bullock to lose her Oscar because there might be issues with the story the movie told… what does her acting performance to do with the real life story?”</p><p>And a third added: “Saying Sandra Bullock should have her Oscar taken away is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aDcMDHnmSbpJmjsW6%2FyJ2cZquklr9ustSmoKefXZbAbrLAp6pmnJWirq%2BwjK2mZqukp7axedKapZ2qkWKvtrjLqJqkZZ%2Bbeqmx0WamrJuRp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mother-of-lisa-left-eye-lopes-is-suing-automaker.html><span>←</span><span>Mother Of Lisa &amp;quot;Left-Eye&amp;quot; Lopes Is Suing Automaker</span></a>

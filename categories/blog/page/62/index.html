When you’re rich, you can afford to pay others to chauffeur for you. Hollywood is full of celebrities who have opted to skip the driving test for good. Ironically, those same, non-driving A-listers insist on owning cars anyway. Ed Sheeran bought his first car, post celebrity status success, even though he didn’t yet have a license. He was 24 years old when he took and passed his test. Some suggest it was owning his first car that incentivized him to get his driver’s license.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>K.

Kelsea Ballerini is entering a new, more emotionally vulnerable phase of her career with the release of her new single, "Homecoming Queen?" The singer-songwriter focuses on simple songcraft and stark emotion on the first song fans have heard from a forthcoming third album.
The track focuses on a stripped-down acoustic guitar figure, keeping the focus on Ballerini's voice and lyrics that offer up a very confessional mood. Though the lyrics ostensibly tell the story of a homecoming queen who feels like she can't show the world her true, vulnerable self, one can't help but feel that Ballerini is drawing on her own life.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Luna Rosa abril 2024: qu es, horarios en Mxico, significado espiritual, cmo y dnde verla hoy</h2><time>Jun 23, 2024</time>

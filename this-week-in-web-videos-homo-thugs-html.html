As episode #1 streamed, I braced for regret. Then it dawned on me that the series’ hoodtastic protagonists were…gay, and I turned up the volume.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc19zn9984ldsg2gu1@published data-word-count=134>In a <a href=#>recent interview</a>, DJ Vlad asked rapper Fat Joe if he thought he’d ever worked with a gay rapper. His answer: “yes…niggas is gay” — not surprising at all if you think about it, but initially shocking because of the relentless machismo, the “suck my dick, bitch” bravado so many of the genre’s artists employ to sell records. The notion of rappers being outtable is the ultimate contradiction and, more, an implicit recognition of homosexuality as a natural preference, not one to be mocked as it so often is in rap. Homo Thugs, created by and starring New York comedian/actors Jermaine Fowler (CollegeHumor, The Eric and Andre Show, In Living Color) and Kevin Barnett (MTV’s #FAIL, CollegeHumor), taps into this electric incongruity and turns it into a goofy project with real staying power.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc19zo9984358awfhs@published data-word-count=17>I had a chance to catch up with Fowler and Barnett. Here’s what they had to say.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc19zp9984iul2eio3@published data-word-count=7><strong>What did you guys do before this?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc19zq9984za5jwxvn@published data-word-count=65>Kevin: We’re both stand-ups. I did a lot of things before that, that I either failed at or was too fat for.&nbsp;I was a musician, martial arts trickster, BMX rider, and personal trainer. I was confused. I’d kind of been dabbling in comedy since high school, and then moved to NY to pursue it when I decided I didn’t care about love, and meaningful relationships.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc19zr9984lnhvlnf2@published data-word-count=25>Jermaine: Before I was living in Hyattsville, MD.

There are a lot of things you see/hear in the streets that are so insane, and hypocritical that it almost needs to be pointed out and made fun of. We love to make fun of ignorance, and feel like it’s necessary in a way. Also one time we saw some MMA fighters wearing tight spandex shorts and we ain’t gay but we respected them butts.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc19zu9984to9fltca@published data-word-count=24>Jermaine: There’s so much comedy amidst all the hate.

Maybe it helps some of the really homophobic people to see how ridiculous they’re being. Ain’t no reason to hate cause a nigga like a nigga’s butt. What if that nigga had a really good butt?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc19zx9984byaw6c1j@published data-word-count=18>Jermaine: Yeah like so what if a dude like man-butt?

Writing on some TV shows, on camera for a couple others, more web, stand-up. But really we are working on our beautiful friendship, and also I’m trying to figure out how to holler at Puerto Rican girls. #butts</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc1a009984osk29rci@published data-word-count=43>Jermaine: I’m working on a few television projects, but right now I’m trying not to get caught uploading this new Bangbros scene at the Apple store.

A bad camera/editor can really drain all the funny out of a good script/good acting. Our guy, Kenji, is a beast! He has great timing with editing, does great camera work, and is passionate about what he does. Don’t let a good idea be ruined by lazy edits/camera work. A 4x1 is only as fast as its slowest sprinter, a great guitar solo can be ruined by bad drumming, and strippers can’t grab poles without hands. The team is important. Also you should work out a lot and get mad stretch marks.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc1a039984vvua7cfo@published data-word-count=50>Jermaine: Agreed. A dope director can make your comedy translate to your audience seamlessly which is what our half-white and Japanese slave, Kenji, does very well. We pay him in promises. Also, cocoa butter is good for stretch marks, but Kevin is Jamaican so I think they believe it’s food.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc1a0499844f6z21el@published data-word-count=7>And now, your three reasons to watch.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0t93qc1a059984geqaqrrt@published data-word-count=3><strong>1.

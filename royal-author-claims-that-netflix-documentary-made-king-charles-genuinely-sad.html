He was angry but didn’t want people to speak ill of his son in front of him, either. It was a brief moment where he paused and realized how bad things had become.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Opinion: Omid Scobie’s Endgame is just another Harry and Meghan pity party</a></p><p>However, things soon changed when he realized the work the <a href=#>royal</a> was doing was being “overshadowed.”</p><p>Writing about one charitable donation, Scobie penned: “Charles personally donated “substantial” funds to the Felix Project, a charity that redirects surplus food from farms, manufacturers, and supermarkets to food banks. A large chunk of their £1 million starting funding came from the monarch, a noble deed, but the Sussexes and Netflix were all the press could talk about.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-an-error-in-endgame>An ‘error’ in Endgame</h2><p>The book has caused more rifts than expected, as the Dutch version of the book <a href=#>supposedly named the two people who made comments</a> about Harry and <a href=#>Meghan Markle’s</a> son Archie and the color of his skin before he was born.</p><p>However, Scobie denied he had anything to do with its printing in an interview on Dutch TV, saying he “does not speak Dutch.”</p><p>He said: “The book is in several languages, and unfortunately I do not speak Dutch. But if there are translation errors, I’m sure the publishers will have it under control.”</p><p>He wrote and edited the English version of the book only, and said that there has “never been no version that I’ve produced that has names in it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-and-harry-may-spend-christmas-away-from-the-royals>Meghan and Harry may spend Christmas away from the royals</h2><p>It comes after Meghan, 42, has hinted she and her husband, 39, <a href=#>will spend Christmas away from the royal family</a> in the US, where they have lived since stepping down from The Firm in 2020.</p><p>During this year’s Variety’s Power of Women awards, Meghan <a href=# rel=nofollow>spoke</a> to E! News about her family and Christmas.</p><p>She told the outlet: “We’re creating new ones now that our little ones are growing up. And we’re enjoying every moment of it.

Read on as we explain how HDCP works, why it breaks your TV, and how you can fix it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-hdcp>What Is HDCP?</h2><p>HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) is a form of Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM protocols are designed to protect content creators and distributors against piracy. Different companies and industries use different protocols, but the basic premise is the same: DRM locks purchases you make to you and your devices. When you buy a movie on iTunes and can only play it on devices with your account, you're experiencing DRM.</p><p>Content creators and distributors&nbsp;should&nbsp;be afforded some protection, since it's expensive to create and distribute content.&nbsp;The trouble is that&nbsp;DRM typically makes life more difficult for honest paying consumers---and in many cases outright breaks the experience---while not really doing much to deter piracy. This is the kind of trouble we run into with games that require authorization servers to run; if the company goes under so does the authorization server and suddenly the game won't run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the case of the HDMI standard and digital video,&nbsp;the&nbsp;HDCP DRM standard causes an unfortunate&nbsp;number&nbsp;of headaches for regular old consumers just trying to enjoy their televisions and engage in other legitimate activities.</p><p>HDCP was developed by Intel and is used not just with HDMI, but with a variety of digital video standards like DisplayPort and Digital Visual Interface (DVI). It provides for an encrypted connection between a content outputting device (like a Blu-ray player, cable box, or streaming device) on one end and a receiving device (like an HDTV or audio-video receiver) on the other end.</p><p>HDCP is everywhere and is built into devices like Blu-ray players, cable boxes, and satellite TV receivers, as well as into streaming video devices like the Roku, Chromecast, and Amazon Fire TV. It's also built into laptops and computer hardware, DVRs, and other&nbsp;modern HDMI devices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Can You Make DVDs Look Better on Your HDTV?</a></span></p><h2 id=where-hdcp-breaks-down>Where HDCP Breaks Down</h2><p>Although&nbsp;HDCP's&nbsp;underlying encryption and protocols are sophisticated and outside the scope of this article, the basic premise of how&nbsp;it&nbsp;works is quite simple. There is a licensing body that issues licenses for HDCP devices. Each HDCP-compliant device, like your Blu-ray player or Xbox, has a license and the ability to talk to the receiving device on the other end of the HDMI cable.</p><p>The outputting device says "Hey display! Are you HDCP compliant? Here is my license, show me your license!" The display (or other HDCP compliant device) returns with "Why yes, I am legit! Here is my license!" When that process&nbsp;works, it happens within a thousandth of a second and you, the consumer, never even notice. You power on your Blu-ray player or DVR, it makes nice with your HDTV, and you live a happy life never knowing what HDCP even is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, however, there are a host of situations where HDCP gets in the way of consumers doing perfectly legal things with their devices and content. If any device in the chain is not HDCP compliant, the video stream will fail.</p><p>For example, if you have an older HDTV set that is not HDCP compliant then you cannot watch&nbsp;any&nbsp; HDCP compliant content on it. If you plug in&nbsp;your HDCP-compliant device to a non-compliant device,&nbsp;you'll either see a blank screen or an error message like "ERROR: NON-HDCP OUTPUT," "HDCP unauthorised," or simply "HDCP ERROR."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/img_54d63ebee1b9d.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Want to turn that old monitor with integrated speakers into a cheap little video box with a Chromecast? Sorry, there's a very good chance that old monitor (despite having an HDMI port) is not HDCP compliant. You won't be streaming anything to it unless you want to dedicate a whole computer to the project.</p><p>Want to record your video game sessions or stream them live? It's hit or miss.&nbsp;Console makers have gotten better about recognizing that players want to record and stream their content, but HDCP is still problematic. The Sony Playstation lineup is a perfect example of this problem. While Sony did release an update in 2014 for the PlayStation 4 that unlocked HDCP while actually playing the game, they can't provide the same update for the PlayStation 3 because the HDCP output is locked at the chip level in the PS3. Their only advice is to buy a capture device that supports component cables and use those instead of HDMI.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Enable HDMI-CEC on Your TV, and Why You Should</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even when we're not actively watching TV or gaming, we&nbsp;still&nbsp;find HDCP to be annoying and intrusive. We write all sorts of tutorials and reviews here at How-To Geek that involve HDMI-based products like the Amazon Fire TV and the like. You know what you can't capture because of HDCP? The on-screen menus while the video content is loaded. It's pretty irritating to have a content protection system get in the way of you reviewing and promoting streaming devices that legitimately deliver content to millions of paying customers.</p><p>There's nothing illegal or unethical about hooking a Blu-ray player up to an old TV, trying to recycle an old computer monitor into a little Chromecast-powered streaming station, recording and streaming your video game play, or trying to capture menus and screen shots to write tutorials and guides, but thanks to a flawed DRM protocol anyone who wants to any or all of those things is left in the dark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-fix-your-hdcp-problem>How to Fix Your HDCP Problem</h2><p>Absolutely no one should have to buy a new television set, upgrade their perfectly fine audio-video receiver, or otherwise spend significant piles of money to solve a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place. Unfortunately, the only official way to comply with HDCP is to buy an HDCP-compliant device.</p><p>The most absurd thing about the HDCP protection scheme is that there is no HDCP-compliant way to circumvent it for legitimate use cases. There are&nbsp;zero&nbsp;methods endorsed or supported by the agency in charge of HDCP that help consumers in any way if they have older equipment or a legitimate non-piracy need to interact with an HDCP-compliant device.</p><p>To add further insult to injury, the HDCP standard has been compromised for years now. Manufacturers continue to pay for licenses and include HDCP in their products not because it's actually helping to stop piracy, but&nbsp;because they don't want&nbsp;with the licensing agency&nbsp;and the anti-piracy lobby. So what can you do to deal with the outdated&nbsp;and now compromised mess that is HDCP?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/img_54d63c1e4a1ab.jpg><p>Short of buying a new television or giving up on your video game project the only way to deal with your HDCP compliance problem is to buy a cheap HDMI splitter that ignores HDCP requests.</p><p>We really wish we were kidding, but that's the secret media center ingredient that has helped thousands of consumers and the very same secret ingredient that we use here at How-To Geek when we need to take screenshots of an on-screen menu to showcase a product we're reviewing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Specifically, we use the&nbsp;<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">ViewHD 2-Port 1x2 Powered HDMI Splitter (Model: VHD-1X2MN3D)</a>&nbsp;($20) because even among cheap HDMI splitters, there is no consistency to whether they will be HDMI compliant (even, sometimes, among products from the very same company). A little careful reading and using the Amazon reviews search function goes a long way toward ferreting out cheap splitters that other consumers have had success with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/img_54d63d1fd6c0c.jpg><p>To use the splitter, simply put it between the&nbsp;output&nbsp;and display device. For example, say you have a simple setup where you just want to plug a Chromecast into an old monitor. Instead, you'd plug the Chromecast into&nbsp;the input&nbsp;on your HDMI splitter, and then use an HDMI cable to connect the output on the splitter to your display. If you have a new audio-video receiver that doesn't play nice with your old HDTV, plug all your HDMI devices into the receiver and then place the HDMI splitter between the receiver and the display.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the photo above you can see the simple setup on our desk, used for capturing menus and screenshots while reviewing HDMI devices. In this example, we're feeding&nbsp;an&nbsp;Amazon Fire TV Stick into the ViewHD splitter, then passing the signal over to the Roxio GameCapHD Pro so we can snap the screenshots on our computer. Where we place the GameCapHD Pro in the chain is where the vast majority of users seeking this solution would have their TV plugged in.</p><p>Here's what our attempts at capturing good screenshots for our tutorials looked like before dealing with the HDCP problem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/img_54d6406490224.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can see how such a screenshot would be pretty useless for our purposes; nobody wants to see what the menu of a device they're considering purchasing looks like with a big ugly error message across the back. In this example, even though we're using a capture tool, you're seeing exactly what a home user with a non-HDCP-compliant HDTV would see: the non HDCP-protected part of the video&nbsp;(the menu bar and pause button) is passed through, but the actual content is removed.</p><p>Here's what the exact same screenshot looks like, but with the signal passed through the splitter to strip away the HDCP nonsense.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/img_54d640a29e039.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can imagine, given our love for clever and thoughtful solutions to the problems that plague people, how absurd we find it that the solution to a problem which shouldn't even exist is "buy an out-of-spec device that ignores the faulty protocol." Nonetheless, that's exactly the situation consumers find themselves in and thankfully, whether through poor or intentional design, there are products out there that get new media players talking to old HDTVs.</p><p>Have a pressing tech question?

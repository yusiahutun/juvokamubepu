"It was an amazing experience. I got to work with director Mike Salomon, who I've known forever because he's done a lot of my father's videos."</p><p>At first glance, it's easy to assume that the video for 'Daddy Dance With Me' is going to be a curated flashback of the happiest day of the young singer's life, but this video is all about fathers and daughters everywhere. The three-minute video intersperses photos from a woman's wedding and childhood -- Sloane Cavitt Logue from Show Dog-Universal, in fact -- in addition to some original footage from her reception. In between nostalgic images, Keith is singing inside a beautiful church.</p><p>"Of course, I was the bride in the song, but it's a theme that applies to all weddings," she says of the video. "We shot the video at a beautiful church in Los Angeles and I'm really excited for the song to get out there."</p><p>Keith obeyed her parents' wishes for her to go to college by completing her degree at the University of Oklahoma--but now she's ready to take her talents into a national spotlight. 'Daddy Dance With Me' appears on the country star's daughter's self-titled EP, which was released April 16. Keith's first full-length album, 'Whiskey & Lace,' will be released later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpKqpqMGiuIyknKKsmGKxorDDspuappOaeri106Fkpp1dq7alsc5o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-riley-smith-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Riley-Smith obituary | History books</span></a>

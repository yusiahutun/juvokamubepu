They’re sleek, versatile, and elegant. Plus, they can be dressed up much easier than their indigo counterparts, while also suiting a casual occasion equally as well. Basically, if you’re in the midst of building your capsule wardrobe, then a pair of black denim is a must. But just like blue jeans or even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>white jeans</a>, for that matter, finding the perfect pair can be tough. That's why we consulted experts and tried a bunch of pairs ourselves to find the absolute best pairs you should buy right now, from distressed picks to ones that perfectly hug your curves. As soon as you have a pair in your rotation, you'll question why it took you so long, too.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-agolde-riley-long-high-rise-straight></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Agolde Riley Long High Rise Straight</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Agolde Riley Long High Rise Straight" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fgWkVID9eU3IWWoW6zjju2LpJrk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/agolde-riley-long-high-rise-straight-bad957a5f77d44f7985ca59d958b2d9f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Agolde</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This straight jean hugs the body but still has a relaxed feel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The brand recommends sizing up if you’re in between sizes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Known for body-flattering silhouettes, vintage-inspired designs, and use of high-quality material, Agolde takes the cake when it comes to denim. The Riley Long High Rise Straight style meets all the standards we look for in a good pair of black jeans: They’re ultra-comfortable, stylish, and have a rich color.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The sleek silhouette and finished hem give these jeans a polished look, and we love that they have a vintage feel to them. We find that a high-rise and straight cut helps to elongate your legs, making us look taller. Plus, this pair also features four utilitarian pockets that are deep enough to store your phone, keys and maybe your wallet. Wear them on casual days with sneakers or to the office with heels or boots.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Note that the inseam is cropped at 26 inches, which may be a little too short for our tall ladies. The brand also recommends sizing up if you’re in between sizes, as the non-stretch denim can feel a bit tight.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 22—34｜<strong>Rise</strong>: High｜<strong>Materials: </strong>Organic cotton, viscose, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-universal-thread-high-rise-slim-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Universal Thread High Rise Slim Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Target Universal Thread High Rise Slim Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qUr2z1UKMyNRoajjJifQi1Vdr-Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/universal-thread-high-rise-slim-straight-jeans-c246ebf1210b4c0bb1573826de323e3f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There is a wide size range, including options for petite, tall, and plus size.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The cropped hem makes this a more of a spring to fall jean, rather than a winter jean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t sleep on Target’s clothing line Universal Thread. The affordable retailer doesn’t skimp out on style, as proven by these high-rise slim straight jeans. You could wear the cropped look to brunch and to work, and no one would be any wiser that you spent a mere $20 on them. Aside from having a wide size range, the jeans come in a variety of lengths as well. Choose between a short (24-inch inseam), a regular (26-inch inseam), and a tall (28-inch inseam). There are plus-size options as well, marked as “w” for wide, which will curve around your hips comfortably. The cropped nature of the jeans might make it a little difficult to wear in the winter (unless you pair it with ankle boots), but for a budget piece, the pants have quite a lot to offer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 00–16, short, regular, long, plus｜<strong>Rise</strong>: High｜<strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-toteme-twisted-seam-high-rise-straight-leg-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TOTEME Straight-Leg Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TOTEME Twisted Seam High-Rise Straight-Leg Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-VrpWA2pe41FjSn2xGRuUwO9nJk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/toteme-twisted-seam-high-rise-straight-leg-jeans-66bc42344bba480dadd5bbb7dd2df707.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>TOTEME</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The unique twisted seams add a chic flare to the classic black jean.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The 28-inch inseam will look quite cropped on taller people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Black jeans are a wardrobe staple that will never go out of style. If you’re willing to invest in a pair that will last forever, Toteme is the way to go. The Original High-Rise Straight Leg Jean is New York-based stylist Jordanna Sharp’s go-to recommendation. “When a brand is known for quality pieces, like Toteme, then it is worth the investment, especially on items like denim that we typically wear over and over,” she shares.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cut from stretchy denim in Italy, Sharp raves about the superior craftsmanship and Toteme’s ability to elevate classics. The twisted seam adds a stylish accent to the pants, giving an elongating illusion. The slightly cropped leg is ideal for showing off new shoes, too. Keeping that in mind, if you’re on the taller side, make sure the 28-inch inseam is to your liking before making a purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 24—31｜<strong>Rise</strong>: High｜<strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mid-rise-rag--bone-peyton-mid-rise-bootcut-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mid-rise</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rag & Bone Peyton Mid-Rise Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rag &amp;amp; Bone Peyton Mid-Rise Bootcut Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pcpasLTE6Kod6BOt9JmQufQjda8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rag--bone-peyton-mid-rise-bootcut-jeans-8794481ba47d49c4bd1664d073745730.jpg"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These jeans are fade-resistant, so the color will stay crisp.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>These need to be air dried.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding a mid-rise jean that hits your waist at the ideal point can seem like a daunting task, but fortunately these pants make it easy. They hit perfectly between the hips and belly button, elongating your legs and accentuating your waistline. The bootcut silhouette makes it a bit more formal, making this great for office days and date nights alike.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our favorite detail is the no-fade material, though. No matter how many times these get washed, they will remain just as crisp as the day you bought them. As long as they’re hung to dry instead of thrown in the dryer, the shape will stay fresh, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 23—32｜<strong>Rise</strong>: Mid｜<strong>Material: </strong>Viscose, cotton, lyocell, polyester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-waisted-redone-70s-ultra-high-rise-wide-leg-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Waisted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RE/DONE '70s Ultra High Rise Wide Leg</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RE/DONE '70s Ultra High Rise Wide Leg Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LC9TgO4ggOktnAG0prLIO6v25SA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/redone-5efc6170f2614345a732cb1e66486f04.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>RE/DONE</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The rigid denim will mold into your body and last a lifetime.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The 32-inch inseam is extra long, making it only suitable for tall ladies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To splurge or not to splurge is not even a question where Re/Done is concerned. With a 100 percent rigid cotton that will last a lifetime, a 32-inch inseam that gives you legs for days, and a flattering waist that cinches in your belly, these jeans deserve the splurge. For former senior commerce editor Chloe Anello, who owns them in blue, these pants have been the highlight of her years of denim experience. As someone on the taller side with wide hips, these pants have been heaven-sent, complementing her figure as if they were custom-made to her curves. That being said, it’s possible the pants are too long for anyone under five foot seven. Unless you’re prepared to pair them with some very high heels, we recommend these pants for our taller ladies.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 23–32｜<strong>Rise</strong>: High｜<strong>Material: </strong>Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-low-rise-levis-noughties-bootcut-womens-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Low-rise</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi’s Noughties Bootcut Women’s Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi&amp;acirc;s Noughties Bootcut Women&amp;acirc;s Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/surtl8ojY_47VtbQ2_qLRKiRX78=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levis-noughties-bootcut-womens-jeans-96418a668f0c43259ad17c46baa1757c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Leviâs</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These come in three different lengths.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The distressed details make them more suitable for casual events rather than formal ones.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These low-rise bootcut jeans combine trends from the early 2000s and the 1970s, giving you a nostalgic pair of denim that every TikToker would envy. But unlike short-lived trends, the superior craftsmanship brought forth by Levi’s would last for decades (basically until the trend gets resurrected again). You’ll even find the classic flap back pockets on this pair, adding to the old-school aesthetic. “They are immaculately constructed and have some great sustainability credentials,” says London-based stylist Joanne M Kennedy. We love that you can choose between two different lengths to find the best fit for your body — a special feature that not many companies offer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The faded color and rips make this pair harder to dress up, so you’ll have to reserve them for your casual outings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 23—34 ｜<strong>Rise</strong>: Low｜<strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, lyocell, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bootcut-citizens-of-humanity-lilah-high-rise-bootcut-30></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bootcut</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Citizens of Humanity Lilah High Rise Bootcut 30"</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Citizens of Humanity Lilah High Rise Bootcut 30&amp;quot;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ggCHzQj4Fo47lZzlJ_H1uaJ_5sU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/citizens-of-humanity-lilah-high-rise-bootcut-30-3842cdfd5caa4aeea72d380c24ce11b7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Citizens of Humanity</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Even through years of wear, these jeans won't lose their shape or fade in color.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They run slightly large, so we recommend sizing down.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Worn with a cool metallic cowboy boot, a fun stiletto, or an effortless black bootie, bootcut jeans are easy to style and instantly flatter your silhouette. Recommended by Kennedy, these sleek jeans are constructed from a blend of cotton, spandex, and polyester, so they easily slide on and hug curves in all the right ways. The sleek design and deep black colorway make these look tailored and polished, too. “I continuously reach for these jeans as they have aged exquisitely and work as a&nbsp; timeless wardrobe classic,” says Kennedy. With an inseam of 30 inches, even our long-legged ladies can sport the flared look. Conversely, if you’re on the shorter side, consider pairing with platform sneakers or heeled boots to avoid having the hem drag on the floor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 23—34｜<strong>Rise</strong>: High｜<strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-boyfriend-elv-denim-sustainable-black-match-boyfriend-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Boyfriend</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>E.L.V.

Love a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>classic boyfriend jean</a>? The oversized style and fun asymmetrical back pocket design on this pair offer a cool twist on the boyfriend cut. Not to mention, the baggier design is hand-crafted from upcycled jeans, so you can feel good about making a sustainable purchase. While the brand does offer a wide size range, if something does not fit you perfectly you can get a complimentary tailoring done through their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">made-to-order services.</a> Having a pair of jeans perfectly tailored to your fit is absolutely priceless.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 25—38｜<strong>Rise</strong>: Mid｜<strong>Material: </strong>Upcycled Cotton, Polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-straight-good-american-good-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Straight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Good Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Good Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9kfpzGTWzsqgcTQufywzPgYsfAM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/good-american-good-straight-jeans-6b2203bb194949d99c8c54df6a0ee55d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They have a great inclusive size range.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The material feels a bit stiff at first, but with a few washes it gives some stretch.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Good American has transformed the jean industry by creating high-quality jeans that flatter all body types, and these straight-leg jeans are no exception. Made of 95 percent organic cotton, this pair hugs your hips and waist deliciously, while coming down into a straight cut. It can be difficult to find jeans with a relaxed fit that don’t completely drown your figure. However, this style immediately accentuates the curves, proudly placing your natural shape on display. Despite making you look like a million bucks, they come at a more affordable price point. Plus, Good American prides itself on offering an inclusive size range, as evidenced by the sizes spanning from double zero to thirty-plus. It’s important to note that these jeans may feel a bit stiff at first, but after a few washes, begin to give a little more stretch. Trust me, you’ll be running back to Good American after you buy these.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 00-30 Plus｜<strong>Rise</strong>: High-rise｜<strong>Material: </strong>Organic cotton, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flare-mother-denim-the-weekender></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Flare</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mother Denim The Weekender</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mother Denim The Weekender" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/J0UXE7y-bG3FRmyFlXLYbhwv5gI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mother-denim-the-weekender-aaa117ed03d74294a481b4c7e13dc0ca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mother Denim</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The stretch denim makes these jeans extra comfortable for all day wear.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The 31-inch inseam might be a little too long for women under five foot seven.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If I could only wear one pair of jeans for the rest of my life, it would hands down be this exact pair. I have never found a more comfortable, flattering, or better-fitting jean, than Mother Denim The Weekender. Assembled from their ultra-soft stretch cotton material, these jeans instantly contour your body. When I first slipped these on I was astonished at how toned my legs and bum looked. I also didn’t have a gap in the back at my waist, like I so often do with jeans. Plus, the flare adds a unique touch to these beauties. It elongates the jeans and gives the pants a cool ’70s vibe that’s trending right now. Style the mid-rise flare with a cropped shirt to play into the trend or pair it with a bodysuit and stiletto boots for a more sophisticated take. Note that the inseam is 31 inches long, which is suitable for women between five-foots-even, and five-foot-nine. Those below might feel the hem drag on the floor, and those above might find the crop to look a little awkward around the ankles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 23-34｜<strong>Rise</strong>: Mid-rise｜<strong>Material: </strong>Cotton</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-skinny-frame-le-high-skinny-in-film-noir></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Skinny</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frame Le High Skinny in Film Noir</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bloomingdale's Frame Le High Skinny in Film Noir" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LtRPD9wOyiLkWY36f5sChMwGBPE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frame-le-high-skinny-in-film-noir-a3b9a98d794e42e6b6a0df6826114ec3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bloomingdale's</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re extremely soft and stretchy, making them comfortable enough to wear all day.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Despite being called a high-rise, these sit a little lower on the belly than traditional high-rise pants.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are the perfect — and we do mean perfect — pair of skinny jeans. Why? Well, to start the stretch denim makes them glide over your legs like melted butter. When commerce writer Bianca Kratky first tried a pair of jeans from Frame, she was flabbergasted that jeans could balance so expertly between soft, thick, sturdy, and stretchy — almost like a professional acrobat. Despite being skin-tight, it’s still made of substantial material and doesn’t look like you just painted pants on. You can squat, kick, and probably do a split in them (if you possess such talents). Although the brand claims them to be high-rise, Kratky finds them to sit a little lower on the belly, so expect a mid-rise cut to arrive in the mailbox.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 23–34｜<strong>Rise</strong>: High｜<strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-curvy-figures-madewell-the-curvy-perfect-vintage-straight-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Curvy Figures</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell The Curvy Perfect Vintage Straight Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Curvy Perfect Vintage Straight Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/naMEy8e5D_1PviWqr6eWD8A7mSc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-the-curvy-perfect-vintage-straight-jean--045d721bf95349db81cc1be070d9ab3e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This jean is offered in plus, petite, standard, and tall.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The distressed hem could tangle or come undone with time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for the perfect <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>high-waisted jeans</a> to accentuate your curves? Madewell’s The Curvy Perfect Vintage Straight Jean is a dream, or at least that’s what plenty of our InStyle editors claim. Oftentimes, those who have a smaller waist-to-bottom ratio (like myself) struggle with finding jeans that fit their bums without gaping at the waist. Fortunately, Madewell fitted these to be more snug around the waist, while curving out around the butt before shooting down to a straight leg. Coming in plus, petite, standard, and tall sizing, there’s an inseam length and a size perfect for all. However, you may want to be careful with the distressed hem —- we fear it may tangle or come undone if not properly cared for.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 23-33, 14W-28W｜<strong>Rise</strong>: High-rise｜<strong>Material: </strong>&nbsp;Cotton, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-frame-le-crop-mini-bootcut-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frame Mini Bootcut Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frame Le Crop Mini Bootcut Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HpVeWCJAbquSDZwfX-dLnfF_1L8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nordstrom-frame-le-crop-mini-bootcut-jeans-746df946bb6d4081bdbe0ed566acf832.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Without any rips or distressing, the pants can be worn just about anywhere.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some shoppers claim the pants run a little snug.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t you just love brands that offer the same favorite styles everyone wears, but in extended sizing? J.Crew is one of those brands, which is why these all-black toothpick jeans can be snagged in a petite (and a tall) as well. To J.Crew, petite means a 26-inch inseam and a nine-inch high-rise, intended for women five foot four and under. The cotton is blended with some elastane and polyester, so you can expect them to stretch over your curves as well. The classic style doesn’t have any rips or unique tailoring to it and instead acts as a clean blank slate for you to dress up or down as you please. Just be aware that some shoppers claim the pants run a little small, so size up if you’re in between sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range</strong>: 23–32｜<strong>Rise</strong>: Midrise｜<strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-spanx-flare-jeans-clean-black></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Flare Jeans Clean Black</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Flare Jeans Clean Black" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dsG1URHAFkZZrtxoF0XODAkx6lE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-flare-jeans-clean-black-6ec925e0707b4c64bca10d461a865755.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Core-shaping technology rounds out your behind while cinching in your waist.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There are no buttons or zippers, so you have to wiggle your way in a little.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Should we talk about how sleek and stunning the right <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>flared jeans</a> can be? Or perhaps, how the hidden core-shaping technology (that’s oh-so-famous at Spanx) in these jeans deliciously hugs your curves? Maybe it’s the deep and rich hue of black that makes these look so classy. Whatever selling point pulls at your heartstrings the most, these jeans simply scream, “Wear me." You can choose between regular, petite, and tall inseam lengths, as well as sizes up to three XL. With a reasonable price tag, there really isn’t much that should hinder you from making these your favorite new pair of denim, except maybe the fact that they are pull-on.

The sculpting waistline also creates a flattering silhouette around your bum, before flaring out and giving your legs some room to breathe. More than the fit, however, you can feel relaxed knowing that the pants were made sustainably, using less water and energy in the process.

Sasha Izum, a personal stylist based in San Diego, emphasizes the need to understand your own physique when picking which style best suits you. “As a stylist, I recommend choosing jeans according to your body type in order to emphasize your strong features with the correct fit,” Izum says. According to Sharp, “High waisted jeans (like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Re/Done High Rise Skinny Boot</a>) are great for women with longer torsos as they wont cut up a woman’s proportions and help elongate [the legs].” Conversely, “I always suggest a mid-rise crop to clients who have smaller torsos and are shorter (typically under 5'4),” she adds. Think <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Rag & Bone Peyton Mid-Rise Boot</a> if you fit in this category. As an easy guide, Sharp finds that wide-leg denim is typically universally flattering, as well as very trendy right now.

Those that are made of 100% cotton, typically stretch less, but last longer. They often soften up over time, even if they feel a little stiff at first, molding into your perfect fit. Jeans that are made of a blend with elastane feel more comfortable around the body, giving you some breathing room. We like to think that skinny jeans, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Frame Le High Skinny</a>, should have that stretchy material blended in, while straight or baggy pants, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">E.L.V. Denim Sustainable Black Match Boyfriend Jeans</a>, can get away with more rigid denim. Overall, splurging on jeans that are made with higher-quality cotton will ensure that your jeans keep their shape over time. Oftentimes, cheaper cotton will get loose and lose its color over time. Stylist Sasha Izum says, “Even if you invest just $100-$200 in a pair of jeans, you will end up wearing them forever as they won't lose shape”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What can I wear with black jeans?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Black jeans can go with numerous different looks and can be taken from day to night with a quick change of shoes or an additional accessory. For stylist Joanne Kennedy, “Black jeans are so versatile, so it is totally dependent on the event, the venue, and the crowd you are with.” For an evening event, Kennedy says “I would select a slimmer, rigid, dark black jeans (as the dark colors tend to be smarter looking), paired with a form-fitting bodysuit and glitzy statement evening bag and killer heels - understated but still impactful.” Stylist Jordanna Sharp is also a fan of styling black denim and recommends “keeping it simple with a gray cardigan and tank top for an everyday look. Sometimes, all black can look a little heavy, so it’s nice to lighten the style up.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I keep black jeans from fading?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In general, buying higher quality denim will prevent your jeans from fading, as the material tends to keep its color and shape better. That being said, we all need cheaper black jeans from time to time, and knowing how to prevent them from fading is key to an elevated outfit. According to stylist Sasha Izum, following the specific jeans' washing and drying instructions is key to denim longevity. But, she also has some preventative tips: “Do not choose charcoal off-black denim, as such jeans look like untrue blacks. Instead, choose slightly faded jeans, similar to shades of wet asphalt.” By choosing those richer black colors, your jeans will remain crisp and bright over time.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us?&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Amanda Rosenthal</a> is a former commerce writer for InStyle, and a true jean consumer.

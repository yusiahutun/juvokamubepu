Okra is one of the most common ingredients that is used worldwide in stews, as a curry, or as a crispy snack. The well-known veggie is also commonly known as bhindi, ladyfinger, and gumbo. Consumed fresh or in a curry, okra is also now on the trending list of healthy diets when consumed as okra water.&nbsp;</p><p>The recipe is as simple as it can be. A handful of washed okra mixed in water gives it a slimy texture and is ready to get into your tummy.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, before you scrunch up your nose and wonder why on earth anyone would voluntarily consume something slimy, hear me out. Okra's sliminess is precisely what makes it so special. Within those gooey tendrils lies a treasure trove of nutrients, including vitamins A, C, and K, as well as folate, fiber, and antioxidants. It's like nature's own power-packed multivitamin, neatly wrapped in a slender green pod. These components have been linked to various health advantages, particularly in the areas of diabetes management and digestive health (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Unlocking 10 Benefits of Okra Water: A Natural Health Remedy","1228905","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7865958/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-okra-water-1228905","1","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>1</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>To enjoy the benefits of okra water, it is recommended to consume it on an empty stomach and first thing in the morning. However, you may also consume it at any time of the day.&nbsp; However, start with a taste test before you fully dig in, and then opt for a full glass daily, although rare, there are chances you might face side effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But let's not forget the fun side of okra water! Sure, it may have a slimy texture that some find intriguing (and others, well, a tad peculiar), and it may take some getting used to, but incorporating okra water into your daily routine may offer a simple and natural way to support your health and enjoy the benefits this vegetable has to offer.</p><h2 id=6579b32300a7d><strong>How to Prepare Okra Water?</strong></h2><p><img alt=" benefits of okra water" title=" benefits of okra water" width=1000 height=714 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-07/1688627358_shutterstock_477829720-1.jpg></p><p>There is no rocket science involved in making this nutritious water. Just follow the steps to the-t and you are ready with your drink!&nbsp;</p><li><strong>Choose Fresh Okra Pods:</strong> Select tender and young okra pods for the best results. Fresher pods tend to have a milder flavor and less stringiness.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Wash the Okra</strong>: Rinse the okra pods thoroughly under cold water to remove any dirt or impurities. Gently pat them dry with a clean <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Unlocking 10 Benefits of Okra Water: A Natural Health Remedy","1228905","https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/amazon-sale-8-kitchen-accessories-will-enhance-look-your-kitchen-1155371","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-okra-water-1228905","kitchen towel","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'>kitchen towel</a>.</li><li><strong>Trim the Ends</strong>: Slice off the stem ends of the okra pods using a sharp knife. This step helps expose the inner contents of the pods.</li><li><strong>Decide on the Size:</strong> You have two options here — either chop the okra pods into small pieces or leave them whole. Chopped okra may release more of its slimy substance into the water, while whole okra pods can infuse the water with a milder flavor.</li><li><strong>Allow It to Soak:</strong> Amber Dixon, our contributor, a registered dietitian and the CEO of Elderly Guides recommend 8 hours of soaking time, typically overnight. She says, “Soaking allows the water to fully absorb the beneficial nutrients from the okra, including its high content of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and folate. The soaking process also helps in extracting the 'mucilage' from the okra, a sticky substance that has been linked to improving digestive health and controlling blood sugar levels.&nbsp;<br>She adds, “The resulting okra water can be consumed directly or can be added to smoothies or other recipes. It's a great way to incorporate the health benefits of okra into your diet, especially if you're not fond of the vegetable's slimy texture when cooked.”</li><li><strong>Allow It to Soak:</strong> Let the okra soak in the water for a minimum of 4 hours, but preferably overnight, to enjoy the maximum benefits of okra water. This will give the water enough time to absorb the beneficial nutrients from the okra.</li><li><strong>Strain And Serve</strong>: After the soaking period, strain the okra water using a fine-mesh sieve or a strainer. Discard the okra pods or repurpose them for cooking if desired. The resulting liquid is your homemade okra water.</li><li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Okra water can be consumed chilled or at room temperature. If desired, you can add a squeeze of lemon, a dash of honey, or other flavorings to enhance the taste.</li><h2 id=6579b32300a85><strong>10 Health Benefits of Okra Water</strong></h2><h3 id=6579b32300a8b><strong>1. May Help Lower Blood Sugar levels</strong></h3><p>Okra water has been suggested to help regulate blood sugar levels,&nbsp; which is a potential benefit for individuals dealing with diabetes or who are prediabetic. This effect can be attributed to the soluble fiber content present in okra (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Unlocking 10 Benefits of Okra Water: A Natural Health Remedy","1228905","https://ijpsr.com/bft-article/antidiabetic-potential-of-abelmoschus-esculentus-linn-in-alloxan-induced-diabetic-rats/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-okra-water-1228905","2","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>2</u></a>).</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>When soluble fiber and water combine in the digestive system, a gel-like material results. This gel slows down the absorption of sugar from food, preventing rapid spikes in blood glucose levels after meals. By reducing the rate at which sugar enters the bloodstream, okra water can contribute to better blood sugar control (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Unlocking 10 Benefits of Okra Water: A Natural Health Remedy","1228905","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9736284","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-okra-water-1228905","3","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>3</u></a>).</p><p>In addition to slowing down sugar absorption, okra water may also improve insulin sensitivity.

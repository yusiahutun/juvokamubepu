Funny, witty, or clever responses to the age-old yet universal greeting question of how are you will, almost instantly, make the asker curious about you. Moreover, depending on your relationship with the asker (friends, colleagues, crush), you can even opt for sarcastic or flirty responses. So, bye-bye boring comebacks!</p><p>So folks, how are you doing? Do you have any fun responses to add to our list?

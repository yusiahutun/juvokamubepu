Golden Computer Centre, which recently experienced its lowest vendor occupancy rate in its history, was so packed with thousands of bargain hunters that shoppers could hardly move. Visitor numbers tripled from normal days, vendors said. Sales at CompuMark System Trading, a shop offering monitors and TV sets, exceeded HK$100,000 in three hours, or four times more than on a normal day, proprietor Sam Ho said. 'The overlapping of the two festivals is good because it attracts people's attention,' he said. The shop would also participate in the Wan Chai event.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More than 300 bargains are offered daily at the Sham Shui Po fair. Yesterday, 20 sets of Philips speakers, priced at HK$29, one tenth of their retail price, sold out in 10 minutes. Sixty Phillips headphones and computer mice at HK$1 each went out the door in about the same time, and 60-gigabyte netbooks, each at HK$1,899 or HK$200 below cost, also sold out. There are more bargains today, among them 15 AOC 42-inch LCD TV sets at HK$3,999 and 60 Viewsonic 19-inch monitors at HK$599.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although the products are cheap, they come at a price: the first shoppers arrived to queue outside the Golden Computer Centre at 5am yesterday, and all 300 tokens which enable one to buy one of the limited-offer items, were gone by 8.30am.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tsang Yick-chui, 48, started queueing with his wife and son at 7am to buy two BenQ 19-inch monitors and a netbook for HK$2,998. 'The monitor at home didn't break down,' he said. 'But it's so cheap I want to get an additional one.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alex Lee, a 19-year-old student, said he planned to buy a HK$299 external hard disk and would also attend the Wan Chai fair.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Deals, deals, deals</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More than 300 bargains are offered daily at the Sham Shui Po computer fair</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sixty-gigabyte netbooks were sold in double quick time for HK$200less than cost at, in HK dollars: $1,899</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdnZ392gJVoq6Gnpaiur7DSZqeam5tiwKmtzGaqoa2ZYr2wecKopKmtpJq%2FbrLErKuirpGheqOxxqKlrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-5578c8a6-7474-5aa2-a566-e4107b9a409e-html.html><span>←</span><span>Raiders name JoJo Wooden player personnel chief | National</span></a>

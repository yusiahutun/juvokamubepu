Offset shares Jordan with <strong>Justine Watson</strong>, Kody with <strong>Oriel Jamie</strong> and Kalea with<strong> Shya L’Amour</strong>.</p><p>“When I was pregnant with Kulture, a lot of people [were] like, ‘Oh, he has three kids already; why would you have a kid with somebody that has three kids?'” Cardi recalled in <a href=#>a December 2019 Vogue interview</a>. “And it’s like, how is that such a bad thing? My dad has eight kids, and we all get along, and it feels better, fuller. And with Offset, I feel like his kids just bring a pop of fun to life when they’re in his house. I actually love it. It brings out a different side of him that I like to see, and I love to see my baby interacting with her siblings. The more the merrier.”</p><p>Two years later, Offset praised his wife’s<a href=#> stepparenting skills</a> during an <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> appearance, saying, “My other kids who ain’t hers … [she] gives them love the same way. It’s a beautiful thing.”</p><p>The “Bad and Boujee” rapper was 17 when his first child arrived, and he described his growth as a father to Haute Living in February 2019.</p><p>“It’s challenging when you have a career like this and you’re constantly on the road,” Offset explained to the outlet at the time. “It makes it tough to see your kids, especially when they’re young. Now that I’m older, though, I’m learning my way. … My children are everything to me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Georgia native said that he likes bringing his little ones on the road, adding, “Whenever I get a few days, I bring them with me because I need to spend that time with them. The influence you have on your kids is incredible, so you have to be very aware of the example you’re setting and make sure you’re influencing them in the right way because they watch you.”</p><p>Scroll through to check out Cardi’s most relatable quotes about raising her and Offset’s two children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksKK%2Bw6Jkm6tdory0wIyrnKWZpJavrbGMqqyorJWoerC6jKamraCVp7Wwu8No</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alison-pill.html><span>←</span><span>Alison Pill Biography</span></a>

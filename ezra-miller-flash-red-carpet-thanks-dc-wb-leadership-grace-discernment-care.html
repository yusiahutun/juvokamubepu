The fewer distracting thoughts about the film's lead(s), the more fans can focus on the content of the film itself.</p><p>As noted by Miller, it's been almost a decade from when they were first cast to star in the film. They would go on to appear as the character in the 2017 "Justice League" film and even in The CW's "Crisis on Infinite Earths" crossover event opposite Grant Gustin's Flash.</p><p>After a very long wait, "The Flash" finally hits theaters this Friday, June 16.</p><a id=gallery-link-c1675e8f-b3e0-48be-b236-3ae78fccd7a5 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:c1675e8f-b3e0-48be-b236-3ae78fccd7a5 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:0d0b656c-aa15-44a8-8eae-0bc011d51753 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8b/4by3/2023/06/13/8b0027230b25419e89e60fe231517344_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29mampfmsezrYymoKWklad6p7jArJ9mqpWZeqSt0amcrWWkna6vt9Jmm5xlp5d6rbHAnZyrq5ievW6z0ZqanmWUnsCksdGnpJ6mpGKwor7EaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charles-addams.html><span>←</span><span>Charles Addams</span></a>

Her left hand is visible in the shot—but instead of her usual three-stone ring on her finger, she had on a pair of simple gold bands.</p><p>Royal detractors were quick to point out that Meghan’s engagement ring was missing from the photograph, especially as rumors continue to swirl about her <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1276004>relationship with Prince Harry</a>. A month before Meghan was seen without her ring, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://radaronline.com/p/prince-harry-meghan-taking-time-apart-marriage-troubles/>RadarOnline</a> reported that the Duchess of Sussex and her husband were “taking time apart” from each other. However, a source close to the couple later told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://pagesix.com/2023/07/18/rumors-swirl-theres-trouble-in-paradise-for-prince-harry-meghan-markle/>Page Six</a> that the rumors about their marriage hitting a rough patch simply weren’t true.</p><p>So, what really happened to Meghan Markle’s engagement ring? Read on below for everything we know so far.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=15.420205920206><h2>What happened to Meghan Markle's engagement ring?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/meghan-markle-engagement-ring-missing.png><p>While it’s true that Meghan Markle’s engagement ring was nowhere to be seen during her recent outing with friends, this doesn’t spell any trouble in paradise for her marriage with Prince Harry. According to a source close to the couple who spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a>, Meghan’s engagement ring is simply “being fixed.”</p><p>Prince Harry first proposed to Meghan Markle in November 2017 with the stunning engagement ring, which was worth around $150,000 at the time. The ring, which was custom designed by Harry, featured a large center diamond from Botswana—a country they visited together less than a month into their relationship.</p><p>“It was I think about three, maybe four weeks [after our first date] that I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana,”&nbsp;he revealed during their engagement interview with the BBC in 2017. “And we camped out with each other under the stars … she came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic.”</p><p>Prince Harry also included an homage to his late mother in Meghan Markle’s engagement ring, which features two smaller stones from Princess Diana’s personal collection.</p><p>“The ring is yellow gold, because that’s [her] favorite, and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana, and the little diamonds either side are from my mother’s jewelry collection to make sure that she’s with us on this — on this crazy journey together,” he shared in their engagement interview.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=15.3538654934><h2>Did Meghan Markle have her engagement ring changed?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/meghan-markle-engagement-ring-change.jpg><p>As it turns out, this wouldn’t be the first time that Meghan Markle’s engagement ring is getting some TLC. In fact, Prince Harry updated his wife’s engagement ring in honor of their first wedding anniversary in 2019. Instead of the original yellow gold band—which Harry said he had chosen because it was Meghan’s favorite at the time—Meghan’s resigned engagement ring features a thin, micro-pavé band.</p><p>Harry reportedly gifted Meghan the updated ring along with a new wedding band. In the royal biography <a data-pmc-sp-product=4c9565f0bbc248dba23fa97a234d2783 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Finding Freedom","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family","price":"15.13","id":"0063046105","category":"Europe"},"id":1627969,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Finding Freedom</a> , authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand explained, “On May 19, 2019, Harry also surprised his wife of one year with the gift of a ring that he had created with jeweller-to-the-stars Lorraine Schwartz, a favourite of Meghan’s.”</p><p>“The conflict-free diamond eternity band paid homage to the family of three with Meghan’s, Archie’s and Harry’s birthstones (peridot, emerald, and sapphire, respectively) on the underside of the ring.”</p><p>The Duchess of Sussex debuted the updated version of her engagement ring at 2019’s Trooping the Colour ceremony. While it’s unclear if Meghan Markle’s engagement ring is getting another facelift in 2023, one thing’s for certain: it’s stunning.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

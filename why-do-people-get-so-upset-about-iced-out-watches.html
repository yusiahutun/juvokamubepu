I could sell it anywhere, anytime, and open like 10 salons, bitch. I’m so proud of myself.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her watch, in other words, is an investment: a tangible object that will not only hold value, but actually appreciate. Sounds about right … right? When I first found the video, I didn’t bother to question the validity of her statement. As a newly minted enthusiast, it didn’t cross my mind to fact-check that this $100K watch would indeed still be $100K (or more) in five, 10, 20 years. I assumed that all watches, blinged out or not, would appreciate in value.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The vitriol alone lets you know it’s about more than just a watch.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s been more than a year since I first saw the Cardi video, and my horological knowledge has, in fact, appreciated. Studying watches has led to an expansion of my vocabulary, and now I understand the meaning of words like factory and aftermarket. Factory is a term used to indicate that everything on a watch comes from its manufacturer—it remains untouched by any third party. Aftermarket, conversely, refers to anything added by customers or dealers after the watch has left the factory, from a funky-colored dial to a bustdown bezel. To some collectors and experts like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/kelly_yoch/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kelly Yoch" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Kelly Yoch</u></a>, the director of client relations at Watches of Switzerland, the latter term might as well be a slur.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Adding aftermarket customization of any kind devalues the watch from its original form in which the craftsmen, who are truly artists, envisioned,” she explains. A watch’s price instantly declines the second you pop an aftermarket diamond on it. Equipped with this information, I revisited Cardi’s video, asking myself whether or not she’d make a profit if she ever had to sell her Nautilus. The simplest answer to that question would be no.</p><img alt="cardi b wears a rose colored sequined set and shows off her customized diamond studded wristwatch" title="Cardi B and Her Customized Watch" width=2118 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-918877878-1643227001.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Shareif Ziyadat</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Cardi B</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But, as with most things in life, the world of watches is anything but simple. Yoch, for example, represents just one facet of the community. In her words, she’s a purist, existing in a camp with other collectors who believe that factory is king and anything that deviates is lesser than. I respect Yoch and understand that her steadfast principles stem from a place of experience and true authority, but I’ve also noticed that within the purist community, there’s a different type of enthusiast seething with opinions that deserve closer scrutiny.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Anytime I repost a photo of a customized watch on my watch account, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/dimepiece.co/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Dimepiece class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dimepiece</a>, the DMs reliably come in from followers signifying their distaste with the puke emoji or its verbal equivalent. It started to irk me how comfortable people were with doling out their criticism, more often than not fired at watches belonging to Black celebrities. Facts are facts, and personalizing one’s watch does, in most cases, devalue it, but these attacks were brimming with a sinister energy.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Why is everyone so pressed? Do they really care that much about ‘integrity’?<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The vitriol alone lets you know it’s about more than just a watch,” private jeweler and GIA-certified Gemologist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/sevenjunejewelry/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Zenobia Morrow" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Zenobia Morrow</u></a> explains. “In Cardi’s case specifically, there are layers of misogyny, racism, and classism at play.” Here, Morrow begins to illuminate what had been gnawing at me instinctively. Why is everyone so pressed? Do they really care that much about “integrity”?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Isabella Proia, specialist with Phillips Watches, echoes Morrow’s sentiment from within the rarefied air of the auction world. “Whether it’s overt or subconscious, these negative comments come from a place of institutional racism,” she states. “I’ve been in the industry long enough to know that aftermarket diamonds are not the sole purview of any one race or ethnicity, but the comments on these images are often overly vicious and derogatory.” Of course, it’s not only Black people who wear customized watches, but it’s difficult to ignore the consistency with which they are targeted.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The term bustdown refers to an original luxury watch being taken apart (a.k.a. bust down), and then drilled and filled with diamonds or other gemstones. “This kind of customization is informed by the music,” Morrow explains. “Sampling and remixing are foundational elements of hip-hop music and culture, so it makes sense that the remix concept would extend to style, jewelry, and, of course, watches.” Indeed, this approach came onto the scene in the ’90s through hip-hop, with artists like Master P commissioning jewelers to personalize Rolex President watches. At the time, this watch was the crème de la crème for the rap game, and adding a little extra shine took it to a whole new level.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fast-forward to the early 2000s’ Bling Era, when ice was thrust into the mainstream via the increasingly popular, New Orleans–based Cash Money Records crew. “Medallion iced up, Rolex bezelled up / And my pinky ring is platinum plus.” Rappers like Lil Wayne had every high school jock and their mother talking about “bling bling,” and in the meantime, aftermarket diamond settings only got more sophisticated.</p><img alt="ludacris shows off his watch which is studded with diamonds" title="Ludacris and His Customized Watch" width=2280 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-106741779-1643227093.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">L.

Yes, another Nautilus—while Audemars Piguet, Richard Mille, and, of course, Rolex watches are frequently customized, Patek Philippe watches are currently the ultimate watch to bust down.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, this may feel like a slap in the face to those who deem Patek Philippe the epitome of haute horology. What a violation it is to devalue a watch that, in the eyes of many collectors, is perfect. Pure.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Pure is a loaded word, weighed down by historical baggage.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pure is a loaded word, weighed down by historical baggage and indicative of rampant elitism within the luxury industry. “Any customisation, as far as [Swiss watchmakers are] concerned, is an act of vandalism,” Alfred Tong wrote for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/virgil-abloh-patek-philippe-watch data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="British GQ" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>British GQ</u></a> in 2019. “Patek Philippe watches are conceived of as heirlooms to be handed down over the generations. Its famous advertising slogan ‘You never actually own a Patek. You merely look after it for the next generation’ shows us that conservatism runs deep within this company.” Good for you if you get passed down a Patek. And even if you did have the money to afford one of the brand’s highly sought-after references (which will set you back $100K minimum), good luck finding one.</p><img alt="russell westbrook at the 2021 met gala with his watch peeking out of his sleeve" title="Russell Westbrook and His Customized Watch" width=2315 height=3473 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1340170724.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mike Coppola</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Russell Westbrook and his Greg Yüna original.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Virgil Abloh considered the concept of purity, using the binary of “the tourist” and “the purist” as the organizing principle with which he creates. “A tourist is someone who’s eager to learn, who wants to see the Eiffel Tower when they come to Paris,” he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2021-menswear/louis-vuitton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said</a> in 2018. “The purist is the person who knows everything about everything.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shortly after Abloh’s untimely passing, HODINKEE’s Nick Marino <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/virgil-abloh-changed-the-way-we-think-about-watches data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="identified this approach" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>identified this approach</u></a> as the driving force behind the designer’s mind-boggling takes on not one, but two, Patek Philippe Nautiluses. “His personal piece was a blackened [reference] 5726, ionically pulverized and ruthlessly murdered out by the wizards at MAD Paris,” Marino writes. “Rarely does one watch say so much. It said: I paid for this, and I can do what I want with it. It said: Your finished product is my starting place. It said: I can top your masterpiece.” Behind this bold statement is an underlying current of openness and curiosity rarely found within a purist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, there are ways to think about vintage watches that don’t buy into the murky ideology around purity. Writer and anti-racism consultant <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/danielleprescod/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Danielle Prescod" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Danielle Prescod</u></a> says that for her, the appeal of an original watch is twofold: It’s the aesthetic, but it’s also about being mindful of your impact on the world. Having relocated from New York City to New Orleans, Prescod lives in the hometown of bling, yet when she went to buy her first luxury watch, she gravitated toward a vintage, diamond-free 26mm Rolex Datejust. In her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://dimepiece.co/FIRST-DIMERS-DANIELLE-PRESCOD data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dimepiece interview" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Dimepiece interview</u></a>, Prescod rhapsodized about the joys of hunting down vintage, which, she argued, is a more sustainable approach. “I would encourage more people to explore vintage, explore consignment. Go greener, get comfortable with that,” she told me. “There’s still this stigma that, if you have money, you should buy things brand spanking new.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prescod pointed out that the watch conversation tends to leave out Black audiences entirely unless it’s about customization. The notion that Black watch fans care only about bling is “a general racist idea that gets solidified when people are shown a narrow representation of what they think a certain group of people does,” Prescod explains. “There are going to be examples of Black people with ‘traditional’ watches, as well as examples of non-Black people with so-called unrefined watches. And that is why a full spectrum of representation is always important.” It’s incumbent on watch media and other horological spaces to make sure they’re telling the full story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ultimately, watch wearing all comes down to personal taste. “You should be buying a watch because you enjoy it,” Greg Yüna says. “The way I look at it is this: If a bustdown watch is what you like, we can do it, and we can do it correctly. But if you are looking at these pieces as investments, keeping everything original is always the best move to make.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So let’s ask the question again: If Cardi B were to sell her Nautilus, would she make back that “hundred thou” on her wrist? Morrow puts it best: “Hello? This is Cardi B. Any discrepancy around aftermarket customization is easily negated by the provenance of it being her watch. She is an international superstar, pop culture phenomenon, and a bona fide fashion icon. Ninety million records sold and she’s just getting started.” Tell that to the purists.<br></p><img alt="miami, florida july 26 megan thee stallion performs at e11even miami on july 26, 2021 in miami, florida photo by alexander tamargogetty images for e11even" title="Megan Thee Stallion Performance At E11EVEN Miami" width=2046 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1330677506.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Alexander Tamargo</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Megan Thee Stallion</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiZY22FeYGTaWpor5iueqW7jKmcqKicmnqosdNmqqhlpaXApsCMmpmoraRitqSxw2amrqxdrK61r8eeqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./saltburn-star-barry-keoghan-loved-going-nude-shock-scene-html.html><span>←</span><span>Saltburn star Barry Keoghan reveals he LOVED going nude for THAT shocking movie scene - after contro</span></a>

I was awarded a scholarship scheme for weekend training at a London contemporary and ballet school, was competing in national competitions monthly, and spent most of my spare time training or performing outside of my studies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bf9621931d60-young-georgia-ballet-z.jpg><p id=eAamGfnZDo4 data-wc=9><strong>As a child, I loved being front and centre</strong></p><p id=e9f3pLtgdrw data-wc=30>Spending up to eight hours a day in front of a mirror, most of which in a leotard, was hell for my mental health as my curves began to develop.</p><p id=eH8yB3cH_z9 data-wc=49>I went from always wanting to be front and centre and loving the spotlight to crying before classes, refusing to go on stage, and eventually giving up dancing completely soon after my 18th birthday. It all came down to my sudden lack of confidence - something I still regret.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7b70ab451d20-georgia-childhood-ballet-z.jpg><p id=e2HzYeql89Q data-wc=10><strong>I stopped dancing due to a sudden lack of confidence</strong></p><p id=e1MP8vnPz07V data-wc=24>I've never gone back to ballet, but having the courage to get back on stage was the turning point in learning to accept myself.</p><p id=er_VNS-PPXmZ data-wc=54>I wouldn't say I had a eureka moment that ended my body issues. I'm not sure if it was reaching maturity or a realisation that this was the body I'd been given and I needed to embrace it if I wanted to break out of this depressing cycle of feeling embarrassed about my shape.</p><p id=eSevgo-8LNgJ data-wc=5><strong>MORE FROM THE HAPPINESS HUB</strong></p><p id=eRsen8idZInw><a class=hm-link href=#>How bold beauty rituals helped me accept my Parkinson’s diagnosis</a></p><p id=eDlIPYsE_FOp><a class=hm-link href=#>Mum makeover: ‘I tried glamorous hair extensions at 44 – and feel amazing’</a></p><p id=eq2VR8ONDOTs><a class=hm-link href=#>How moments of love, tenderness and care soften the hurtful sting of racism</a></p><p id=esA4x6sbMN0Z data-wc=36>When I was 22 and in the second year of studying for my MA, I felt confident enough to go back to doing what I loved and on a whim auditioned for a role in Chicago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f327f9323ea3-georgia-brown-ballet-z.jpg><p id=evJz04FYjlM6 data-wc=13><strong>I finally felt comfortable to return to the stage when I was 22</strong></p><p id=ePA20YEBCyUR data-wc=23>During the show, I wore a lace playsuit and showgirl leotard and performed to hundreds of people, and finally felt comfortable in myself.</p><p id=eXMfFfv_1hbI data-wc=37>We went into lockdown a week after the show run ended. It was the perfect time to shut down and reflect on my achievement and how I wanted to change my relationship with my body moving forward.</p><p id=e8bVWucagVWj data-wc=26>I had to go back to basics and remind myself that my body serves a purpose and isn't here purely to look good in a leotard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bda741890647-georgia-ballet-z.jpg><p id=ewPsoTDEjmac data-wc=6><strong>Appreciating myself has boosted my confidence</strong></p><p id=e6AdJ58RknQG data-wc=26>My curvy figure may not have been right for a professional ballerina, but it's great for so many other things and is what makes me, me.</p><p id=eb95RdG6U_C6 data-wc=62>Appreciating myself as I am has made a major difference in my confidence. Growing up I was constantly conscious that I had to remain a certain size to fit into costumes and look "aesthetically pleasing" on stage, but now that I've quit that mindset, I'm too busy enjoying life and appreciating my family, friends and opportunities than getting upset about my weight!</p><p id=e2n_7ldR33Co data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>I spent 20 years hating my hair </a></strong><a class=hm-link href=#>—&nbsp;here's how I learnt&nbsp;to accept my curls</a></p><p id=epZZaYtl3Yj8 data-wc=12><strong>Subscribe to <a class=hm-link href=#>Hello Happiness,</a> to receive your ultimate guide on how to be happier.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45rZ2tqYWd%2BdX2Ucmxval%2BXvKXFjKKkmp%2BVYq6kr8Spq5qmk5p6pa3NnJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aupen-purpose-bag-celebrity-trend-7503219.html><span>←</span><span>Hailey Bieber and Dakota Johnson Wear This Asymmetrical, $140 Bag</span></a>

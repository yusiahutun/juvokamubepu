Then, the emotion of the moment set in.</p><p>“It took a second,” Block shares. “It felt so unreal, I’m like, 'Oh my goodness, what is this?' And then five minutes later I’m like [crying].”</p><p>Block was nominated alongside <a href=#>Lily Rose</a>, <a href=#>Lainey Wilson</a>, <a href=#>Caitlyn Smith</a> and <a href=#>Tenille Arts</a>, and <a href=#>New Female Artist of the Year went to Lainey Wilson</a> in an early win announced on Friday (March 4).</p><p>During the interview with Taste of Country, Block recalled the moments after she learned of her nomination.</p><p>“I cried all day long&nbsp;— I’m still crying,” she adds. “Especially going into the album release that night, such a whirlwind of a day of all the emotions.”</p><p>From TikTok sensation to a major label artist, Block is entering the new year with big things ahead. The singer’s 12-track album dropped on Feb. 11, an album that sprinkles authenticity of what Block has been through in her life throughout.</p><p>“I tell people it’s sassy, trashy and sad,” she tells Taste of Country. “It’s like a girl trying to get through life, that’s kinda the vibe of this album. You’ve got your heartbreak songs, your party songs, your sad girl songs…the emotions of getting through your 20s, 30s, whatever it is.”</p><p>The 2022 ACM Awards are set to air on March 7 at 8PM ET from Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium. The broadcast will be available via streaming on Amazon Prime instead of airing live on a TV network for the first time in its history. The two-hour program will air with no commercial breaks, but follow its usual pattern of performances and awards.</p><p><a href=#>Jimmie Allen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Gabby Barrett</a>&nbsp;will join&nbsp;<a href=#>Dolly Parton</a>&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href=#>hosts</a>&nbsp;of the ACMs in 2022.</p><p>Remember: The best way to watch the&nbsp;2022&nbsp;ACMs is on TV, with ToC on your phone!</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>2021 ACM Red Carpet Pictures</h2><p>The best dressed on the 2021 ACM Awards red carpet brought color — lots of color — for an awards show that promises to be a celebration.

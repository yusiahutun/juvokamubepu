This method of placing a pan of water in the oven during the baking process is a common step in recipes for cheesecakes and baked custards. But it’s also great to use when baking cookies to prevent the treat from drying out in the oven. This way, you’re not left with a tray of cookies that are too tough to bite into and enjoy. Keep reading to learn more on why this water bath trick helps create the perfect texture within each cookie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why cookies tend to dry out in the oven</h2><p>There are many factors that lead to dry cookies, from adding too much flour to overmixing the dough. But, if you’ve the recipe to a T and still end up with dry cookies, another thing to consider is the role your oven plays. Most ovens don’t generate a lot of humidity, which is needed so <a href=#>moisture can move throughout baked goods</a> like cookies. This, along with overbaking the treats, can lead to a dry, crumbly batch of cookies. Luckily, adding more moisture into the oven is as simple as creating a water bath.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make cookies more moist with a water bath</h2><p>Placing a water bath in the oven does wonders. “Baking cookies with water helps to keep them moist and&nbsp;tender by creating a steamy environment inside the oven,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Norah Clark</a>, pastry chef and food editor at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Boyd Hampers</a>, explains. “This steam is&nbsp;generated when the water in the pan turns into vapor, which then circulates&nbsp;the cookies, preventing them from drying out.”</p><p>All you need to do is place a wide baking pan on the rack next to or below the cookies and gently fill it with 1 to 2 inches of hot water. Then, fully slide the rack into the oven and bake. If you’re making several batches of cookies, refill the tray as needed when the water looks like it’s evaporated.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does a water bath affect the cookie baking time?</h2><p>All ovens are different, but this trick shouldn’t throw off the baking time too much. The main thing is that you’re closely watching the cookies so they don’t overcook. “They should be golden brown and crispy around the&nbsp;edges, but still soft and chewy in the center,” Clark says.

To serve, spread whole stars with jam; top with cutout stars.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to store cookies so they stay moist</h2><p>Storing the baked and cooled cookies correctly is also important as excess exposure to air could cause them to go stale. “Soft and chewy cookies should be stored at room temperature in an airtight container,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Jacobs</a>, blogger and author of The Chocolate Chip Cookie Book (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $26.49</a>), explains. “Crunchy or crispy cookies should be stored separately from soft cookies in a container with the lid partially unsealed. The moisture trapped in the container will soften the cookies.” Once stored, you should be able to enjoy them for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2 to 3 weeks</a>. Although it’s not surprising if loved ones devour the entire batch of tender cookies right away!

But Concetta Brooks’ family and friends were all smiles there Monday morning when she was sworn in as Jones County’s new chancery clerk.
Judge Frank McKenzie administered the oath&nbsp;of office as her husband Russell held the Bible for her.
“This is the first time in the history of Jones County that we’ve had a female chancery clerk,” McKenzie noted before she took the oath."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He was a little more than midway&nbsp;through his second term when he announced that he was resigning to help tend to his family. Brooks worked with&nbsp;him for the last five of his eight years in the circuit clerk’s office and was with him the whole time he served as chancery clerk. She wants to continue serving the way he did, she said.</p><p>“Honesty and hard work” is the advice Ishee offered, Brooks said. After she was sworn&nbsp;in, Brooks administered the oath of office to her deputy clerks — Jeanetta Brown, Brittany Welch, Britney Gleason, Noel Phillips, Deborah Jones, Angie Herrington, Jan Hughes, Carol Brownlee, Lucille Holifield, Debra Spalding, Debbie Knotts and Sheila&nbsp;Godard.</p><p>The Board of Supervisors unanimously accepted Ishee’s recommendation that Brooks be appointed to take his place. There will&nbsp;be a special election in November to finish the final year of his second term. Brooks has said she will run for the position then and two-term Circuit Clerk Bart Gavin has said he will, too.</p><p>The chancery clerk&nbsp;gets a base salary of $125,000 plus a percentage of fees collected that pushes the annual pay to well over $150,000. The chancery clerk maintains records for the Board of Supervisors and the chancery court, which has jurisdiction over divorces and custody disputes, as well as sanity hearings, wills and land matters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwuM6cmKVnkqe8sLfSZqSao5Woeqm10q2mq7FdlsBuusSwZJygkaOwpr7YZpqlnaKgfKK%2B06KapZ2PbIRxr8GfamplaWp%2BdXmUbWucZZGbfXZ5kJ1ubZ1imoF5fsBwZaGsnaE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-emojis-explained-cheat-sheet.html><span>←</span><span>The 150 Most Popular Emojis Explained</span></a>

While talking about her double mastectomy in a new interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a>, the actress said when she received reconstructive surgery, she was very adamant about getting what she wanted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I know a lot of women want to go bigger, but [I said] go smaller,” she said about her conversation with her doctors. “It’s so important to say what you want out loud—and don’t stop. Even as the anesthesia was making its way into my body, the last thing I said was, ‘Please go smaller.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Munn decided to keep her battle private after being diagnosed in February 2023. After ten months and four surgeries, Munn <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>revealed her diagnosis</a> on Instagram last month. In the post, Munn wrote she was "so thankful" for her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>partner John Mulaney</a>, with whom she also shares 2-year-old son Malcolm. The star told the publication just how dedicated Mulaney was, saying he was "happily" by her side through it all.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It would’ve felt like climbing an iceberg without him,” she told People. “I don’t think he had a moment to himself between being an incredibly hands-on father and going to and from the hospital—taking Malcolm to the park, putting him to nap, driving to Cedars-Sinai, hanging out with me, going home, putting Malcolm to bed, coming back to me. And he did it all happily.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elsewhere in the story, Munn explained how their toddler kept her fighting during the many procedures and hospital stays and that&nbsp;“having a little baby at home made everything much more terrifying.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When I’m with him, it’s the only time my brain doesn’t think about being sick," she told People. "I’m just so happy with him. And it puts a lot of stuff into perspective. Because if my body changes, I’m still his mom. If I have hot flashes, I’m still his mom. If I lose my hair, I’m still his mom. That’s really what matters the most to me. I get to be here for him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zqWgr6GRYrq2us1mqZ6bn6PAtb7UnKuirpViwLa%2Bxp6psmWSp7Kiv9Nmmpqmk5q%2FbrDImp6np6OewG6ElWxrcXBj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kiki-layne-isabel-marant-dinner-photo-diary-8634040.html><span>←</span><span>KiKi Layne Gets Ready for Isabel Marant's Celebration Dinner</span></a>

Recalling the moment his wife Meghan Markle visited Clarence House for the first time, he wrote in Spare: "I’d also mentioned that I used to live here at Clarence House, from when I was nineteen until I was about twenty-eight. After I moved out, Camilla turned my bedroom into her dressing room. I tried not to care.

The Duke explained their decision to move into a different royal residence was because Nott Cott was "charming but too small. And falling down around our heads," while the bigger yet not too lavish Frogmore was "a dream come true."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ac8e76f67ff1-prince-harry-meghan-home-netflix-z.jpg><p id=e1Q6WZFwSNv data-wc=31>The couple reportedly spent £2.4 million – which they later refunded the taxpayer – on renovations creating a chic family home before stepping back as senior royals and moving to America.</p><p id=eu0D1jXYu-G data-wc=65>While they made a few visits to their UK home over the past few years, Charles reportedly asked for the keys back in 2023 following the publication of Spare.

Though Ballerini is happily married to country singer <a href=#>Morgan Evans</a> now, she tells Nashville's <a href=#>Tennessean</a> newspaper that for the new album, “I’m writing the most heartbreaking songs I’ve ever written because I understand what went wrong before now. I think the older I get … the more confident I feel about writing that kind of stuff. I write my songs, and I play guitar, and I write about what I’m going through. I’m just really excited to clean the slate again."</p><p><strong>29 Songs From Women in Country That Demand Attention:</strong></p><h3>Kelsea Ballerini's "Homecoming Queen?"

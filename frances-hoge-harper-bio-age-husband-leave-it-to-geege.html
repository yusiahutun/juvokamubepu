The oldest in the family, Frances is filled with wisdom and jokes about her granddaughter’s arts.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Let’s get to know her better as this Frances Hoge Harper Bio proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Frances Hoge Harper On Leave It To Geege</b></h3><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Leave It To Geege </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>premiered on January 12, 2022. But the viewers were shown a glimpse of Frances long before — on its teaser. The clip went:</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Frances: I’m just concerned about one thing…</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Harper: What?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Frances: You doing Nudes! (jokes)</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Harper: Oh my Gosh! (chuckles a little)</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If you’re new to the show <a href=#>Harper</a> is her granddaughter. She is an art enthusiast who attended the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>University of Georgia</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she even did some commission works charging around $50 for mini human figure charcoal drawings.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Frances’s other grandkid is the show’s star, <a href=#>Pootie Taylor</a> (who was diagnosed with autism at 8 months old). His real name is Ainsworth Gatewood Dudley III. Reportedly, Pootie attended </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Beverly Hills High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and later graduated from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Yale University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. But strangely, his FB @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>ainsworth.dudleyiii</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> mentioned that he was from Shanghai, China, and lived in Jerusalem, Israel.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And obviously, Frances’s daughter Geege Taylor is the show’s lead. She helped others on their journey of raising an autistic child. Talking about what makes this show different Geege shared that unlike a bunch of other reality TV shows filled with drama, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Leave It To Geege</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was all about “a family and a community who comes together and supports several people with autism on the show.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Geege recalled the first time the crew of 15 came to her house. “It was crazy,” she said. However, over time she just kind of forgot that there were people in her house with cameras from sunup to sundown.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The filming of the first season was completed in 3 months in December 2021.</span></p><h3><b>Frances Hoge Harper Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Frances Hoge Harper was born in 1942. That made her 79 years of age when she first appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Leave It To Geege</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her daughter </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Geege </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>was around 54 then.</span></p><h3><b>Is Frances Hoge Harper On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Frances wasn’t on Instagram as of 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, reach out to her over Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>frances.h.harper</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Frances Hoge Harper Husband</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Frances Hoge Harper is one of the lucky ones! She was still married to her husband-of-over 5 decades William “Billy” Whitegeah Harper as of 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in Dec 2021, Geege even made an appreciation IG post for her parents — putting pictures of them from when they were young — captioned, “Puddin and Pappy. This is before they got old as hail but even at 100, they still look great.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, they still had a long way to reach 100 then.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“Your folks are gonna kill you for calling them 100!” a comment wrote.</span></p><h3><b>Frances Hoge Harper Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Frances Hoge Harper is retired now. Well, if we have to we can label her job as a “reality star.” But other than that, Frances didn’t seem to have been involved in any other jobs as of 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Growing up, Frances suffered from dyslexia and struggled a lot with her studies. However, she pushed through </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Athens High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in Athens, GA, and later even graduated from the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>University of Georgia</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Knowing the struggles of dyslexia, and having an autistic grandkid, also made her a perfect cast to help others in need.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span style=font-weight:400>Frances’ granddaughter also attended the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>University of Georgia</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Frances Hoge Harper From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Frances could be from Athens, GA.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She spent all of her life there.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>What Is Frances Hoge Harper Maiden Name?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Frances’ maiden name is “Hoge”.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Tall Is Frances Hoge Harper?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>She stands tall at a height under 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm).</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Many Kids Does Frances Hoge Harper Have?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Frances has at least two kids — Geege and Susan Harper.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her daughter, Susan went on to marry Everett Jones III and welcomed three kids with him, namely — Everett Edward Jones IV, Mary Frances, and Catherine Taylor. Unfortunately, Catherine unexpectedly passed away on Feb. 17, 2018, at the age of 17.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Geege, she is divorced twice. One of her ex-husbands is Ainsworth Gatewood Dudley Jr, a Mercer Univ-W. George L.S graduate who went on to become a lawyer at the Georgia State Bar. The pair were married in 2002 and the two kids featured on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Leave It To Geege</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> are theirs. We have no idea why they divorced, but we do know is they were separated before 2010.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fortunately, Geege found love again and was dating a photographer/film producer named Mark George as of 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking more about her family, Frances is the oldest of 5 kids. Her great grandfather is Chancellor David Crenshaw Barrow, after whom the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Barrow Elementary School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in GA, US was named.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, she has an uncle named Legare Walker Hoge Sr. who lived in&nbsp; Athens, Georgia.</span></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmn6qRo7Cmv4yhpqCdXZ2us7zEq2SboZ9irqixjKGsrJqRo7FuuMSarZ5lmal6tbuMoJyen5Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-watch-married-at-first-sight-australia-in-us.html><span>←</span><span>How to Watch 'Married at First Sight Australia' 2024 in US Online Free: 'MAFS' Season 11</span></a>

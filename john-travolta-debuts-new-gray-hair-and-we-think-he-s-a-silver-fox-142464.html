Back in February, the A-lister was spotted on the set of his upcoming movie The Life and Death of John Gotti with the same hairdo! The film ‚Äî in which John portrays deceased Italian-American gangster John Gotti ‚Äî is premiering on Dec. 15, 2017.</p><p>While we‚Äôre loving how the star looks with gray hair, we wonder what his wife, <a href=#>Kelly Preston</a>, thinks of her man‚Äôs updated strands. In a <a href=#>previous interview with Closer Weekly</a>, John revealed the secret to his happy marriage with his woman of 26 years. ‚ÄúWe really care deeply about each other and we protect each other ‚Äî and we keep [our relationship] up to date,‚Äù he said. Kelly added, ‚ÄúKeep checking in and keep growing and changing. Keep doing things, just the two of you.‚Äù The next thing we want is a photo of John and Kelly with his new gray hair!</p><p>This article originally appeared on our sister site, <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a>.</p><p style=text-align:center><b>Click through the gallery below to see John‚Äôs hair evolution through the years!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfnK6tuMSrsGidnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pfKu7x6dkraqRq7ytwMBmm56apanAbrrEsGSgqpGueqmtyKtkmqaUYsSmedOhoKejXZ2ybr%2BMmmSsoZyrsrN5xaivZmlkZ4F3gA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./668736-jayda-cheaves-lil-baby-music-video-go-hard.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Jayda Cheaves Spotted In Lil Baby's New Music Video</span></a>

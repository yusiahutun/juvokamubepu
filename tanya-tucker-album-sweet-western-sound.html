The project finds Tucker teaming up once again with <a href=#>Brandi Carlile</a> and <a href=#>Shooter Jennings</a>, who co-produced the singer's 2019 project, While I'm Livin'.</p><p>Sweet Western Sound is set to arrive on June 2 via Fantasy Records. Before release day, fans can listen to the leading track, "Kindness," which is out on Wednesday (April 5) to coincide with the album announcement.</p><p>"Sweet Western Sound is another revelation and I'm excited to see what folks think of our new endeavor," Tucker says in a statement. "It's ALWAYS a trip working with Brandi and Shooter. I didn't know if we'd be working together again on a new album after While I'm Livin'!! But we did it!"</p><p>Carlile and her collaborative partners and bandmates Tim and Phil Hanseroth co-wrote several of the tracks on While I'm Livin', but Tucker herself is only a co-writer on one of that project's tracks, "Bring My Flowers Now." She spent more time in the writing room for Sweet Western Sound: In fact, Tucker had a hand in penning four of the album's 10 songs.</p><p>"Lots of new things we did this time and I even co-wrote some of the songs, which means a lot to me," she continues. "Brandi says we're MAGIC together, and I'm starting to believe her!!!!"</p><p>Other heavy-hitting songwriters on the track list include Bernie Taupin, JT Nero, Billy Don Burns and Craig Dillingham. The late <a href=#>Billy Joe Shaver</a>&nbsp;— a legendary performer and close friend of Tucker -- also contributed to the album, as a lyric crafted from a voicemail opens and closes the project. Sweet Western Sound's opening song, "Tanya," was co-written by Shaver and Tucker, according to the album credits.</p><p>Tucker has booked two nights at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, for shows that take place right after release day, on June 3 and 4. Tickets go on sale Friday (April 7), and Sweet Western Sound is<a href=#> available to pre-order</a> now.</p><p><strong>Tanya Tucker's&nbsp;Sweet Western Sound Tracklist:</strong></p><p>1.

<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Inside the Rat Packs Joey Bishops Life: How His Hollywood Career Rose and Fell</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Quick-thinking comedian Joey Bishop was on stage at New York’s Copacabana <a href=#>when Marilyn Monroe</a> arrived wrapped in a glamorous white ermine coat. “I told you to sit in the truck,” Joey told her, drawing a big laugh.</span></p><p><span>At the height of his fame in the 1960s, every young stand-up comedian aspired to be Joey, but his rise was swiftly followed by a career decline. In his 50s, Joey found himself back to playing nightclubs again.</span></p><p><span>The Bronx-born performer received his first big break when Frank Sinatra invited Joey to open for him in the early 1950s. “He was a scowling comedian. He bellyached about things in a funny way,” says </span><b>William J. Birnes</b><span>, co-author of </span><i><span>Deconstructing the Rat Pack: Joey, the Mob and the Summit</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>In 1960, Joey joined Frank, <a href=#>Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford in Las Vegas</a> for an event billed as the Summit. The performers would shoot the movie </span><i><span>Ocean’s 11</span></i><span> during the day and do two shows a night at the Sands casino. The act was a huge hit, making Las Vegas the country’s entertainment capital and giving the group a new nickname: the Rat Pack.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Rat-Pack-Members.jpg><p><span>After two decades as a stand-up, the mania surrounding the <a href=#>Las Vegas engagement</a> brought Joey new opportunities. His sitcom </span><i><span>The Joey Bishop Show</span></i><span> debuted in 1961, and he became a frequent guest host of </span><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i><span>. “Instead of appreciating what he got, Joey became carried away with himself. He developed a swelled head,” said </span><b>Richard A. Lertzman</b><span>, another author of </span><i><span>Deconstructing the Rat Pack</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>In fact, when Frank asked Joey to fill in for him on some dates at the Cal-Neva Lodge, a resort he partly owned, “Joey started giving him a list of demands — including $50,000 and a private jet,” Lertzman said. It did not sit well with Frank, who felt responsible for Joey’s meteoric rise. “Not only did [Frank] hang up on Joey, but he completely cut him from the Rat Pack.”</span></p><p><span>Joey’s role in 1964’s </span><i><span>Robin and the 7 Hoods</span></i><span> went to another actor. “There is also a wonderful video of the Rat Pack from a charity performance in St. Louis,” says Birnes. “And the host is Johnny Carson, not Joey Bishop.”</span></p><p><span>Still, Joey persevered. In 1967, his dream came true when he got his own 90-minute late-night talk show. Although other members of the Rat Pack appeared on </span><i><span>The Joey Bishop Show</span></i><span> during its three-year run, Frank was never a guest. Unable to compete with </span><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i><span>, it was canceled in 1969, crushing Joey.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though he ended up outliving the other members of the Rat Pack, Joey always resented that he didn’t get the respect he deserved. “One guy wrote that I worked with the Rat Pack occasionally,” Joey complained. “Occasionally! I know I sound bitter, but I have a right to.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46rmK1loJawrL%2BMo6aesV2XtrS0zqlkoaenYrWqv4yhpqWkqay8sLCMnJirnZWnerO70p5kmqaUYrOmuMto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-manage-the-crouton-linux-system-on-your-chromebook.html><span>←</span><span>How to Manage the Crouton Linux System on Your Chromebook</span></a>

data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Perfume ads can sometimes be extremely serious, but we wanted to do the opposite,” Fanning explains of her first campaign as the brand’s muse. “It’s very, like, playful while still being sexy and sensual. You can see personality shine through.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The campaign has tons of shine, from Fanning in the late designer’s iconic metallic chain-mail dress to the FAME bottle itself, which matches the actress in a similar chain-mail motif and cat-eye sunglasses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We sit down with Fanning ahead of the campaign launch to talk about the fragrance that taps into her nostalgia, the power of a trench coat, and her favorite (also metallic) fashion moments from The Great.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you have a favorite look from the campaign video?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I love the military coat. The brand gave that to me afterwards. The pink silk dress was really pretty too. They have such amazing clothes. I think you only see it for a split second, but I had a bucket hat from the ’60s.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Smelling the fragrance, and watching you in the campaign, you can’t help but want to dress up and go out.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Luckily, the fragrance smells good. It’s really buildable and refreshing—I think because it’s light. You can just spritz a little, and add more later. It’s very much a fragrance I would gravitate towards. And the bottle is so cute. I love how the bottle has so many details: the boots, the earrings, the Paco dress.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>It feels like the campaign pulled inspiration from Brigitte Bardot or Audrey Hepburn. Is there someone who inspires you?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I have had so many role models to look up to. I’ve always been a Marilyn Monroe girl since I was young. I saw a photo of her once when I was seven and was like, “Who is that?” I started watching her films, probably, when I was, like, too young to watch them and was enamored by her presence. I also love Grace Kelly and Katharine Hepburn too. I definitely gravitate towards the older movie stars.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More currently, I look up to Nicole Kidman, Kate Winslet, Jessica Chastain—they’re all amazing. There are so many people I’ve looked up to. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with Nicole and so many talented actors that I really feel like I could reach out to any them and they would be there, which is not always the case.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What an iconic group of role models. Jumping back to the fragrance, what occasion would you wear FAME for?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I wear it every day. I’m a perfume girl. I have to have perfume on always. It makes me feel fresh and complete. FAME is a great scent for going out at night though. The bottle is metallic and slick, and that’s what you want to embody on a night out and ready to take on the world with confidence. But at the same time, I’ll wear it in sweatpants. It’s a fragrance refreshing enough for daytime or nighttime.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What makes you feel instantly confident?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A great jacket. I’m a coat girl, so if I have a long leather coat, like this black one with big shoulders I just bought, I feel really good. I’m tall, so I carry them well. I get them oversized, and it always complete my look.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I’m in London, I’ll wear coats nonstop, because L.A. dressing is so different. It’s much more relaxed, which is not me. I have to remind myself to wear the outfit I like—not what I think makes sense for L.A. dressing. I’m that girl who goes to things overdressed a lot of the time, but that’s just me. I love fashion.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Is there a time when you feel the most glamorous?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I get ready for a red carpet. It’s the ultimate glamour. It can be stressful, but I find it exciting. I’ve always loved putting together a look that expresses myself, and it’s an extension of my creativity. I’ve always had fun with red-carpet looks instead of putting pressure on myself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Cannes was probably the most glamorous moment I’ve had. I mean, there’s nothing like being on that red carpet; it’s huge, exciting, and pure glamour.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Perfume can really transport you. Is there a scent that makes you feel nostalgic?</strong><br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I got to New York, there was a certain chocolate in my room that brought me back to when I four years old and visited New York with my family. It was my first time visiting, and we went to Serendipity and Dylan’s candy store.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Smelling the chocolate brought me back to visiting New York in my childhood, and then I started to miss FAO Schwarz. Even the smell of that store brings back memories, like, the Ferris wheel and the piano.</p><img alt="paco rabanne elle fanning" title="paco rabanne elle fanning" width=2743 height=3428 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/220309-paco-fame-10-012-1-1676265899.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Paco Rabanne</span></p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>It’s crazy how many smells we remember from childhood. After playing Catherine in The Great, what kind of scent do you think she would wear?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Something vodka infused. I don’t think she would wear a super-sweet fragrance. I think it would be more floral vodka. Strong, but with a feminine undertone. Definitely something crisp, like morning air. It’s an interesting question. I know some actors create fragrances for characters and wear them while they’re filming. I’ve never done that. I would be interested to work with someone to come up with Catherine’s fragrance.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Who’s the best-smelling person you’ve encountered?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Patricia Clarkson has a really specific smell. Angelina Jolie has a very specific smell. They’re all very nice scents—when you film scenes with someone, you get very close, physically, so you really smell the other person.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you have a favorite look from The Great?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They’re all handmade, so each one is really incredible. The third season hasn’t come out yet, but there are some really great looks in there. In the second season, Catherine was pregnant most of the time, so the dresses were made to fit the growing bump. I did love the coronation dress, the big gold dress. It was very Russian with the long braid and the bow. It reminded me of a Gucci look or something very couture, [like] if Christian Lacroix designed something back then.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related:</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZppsYm1%2FeIKTamaepJyaeqetzaegp59dpa6ku4yrmJuZnqOybrLAppxmoZ6psrPCyJ6uaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./65e4c13de2704ee27b8b4571-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cundo entra en vigor la nueva ley de paternidad?

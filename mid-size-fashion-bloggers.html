In this particular instance, I was meeting a work friend for pedis and girl talk when our conversation turned to her very stylish Instagram. My friend, Gisele, has style, y’all, and as I praised her chic clothes, great lighting, and fire captions, I let her know that my real favorite part about her feed was seeing someone who looked like myself. Someone not model-thin, but not plus-size, either. For the first time, I wondered why I wasn’t following more <a href=# rel=nofollow>mid-size fashion bloggers</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fashion-month-plus-size.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/black-tiktok-fashion-creators.jpg><p>It hadn’t hit me before that nail salon date, but so many of the people I followed on social media (fashion <a href=# id=auto-tag_influencers data-tag=influencers>influencers</a>, especially) fell neatly into either <a href=#>straight-size or plus-size</a> categories. As a mid-size gal myself, it never occurred to me to seek out similar bodies when scouring the ‘Gram for fashion inspo, though I often found myself wishing I could fit into brands that stopped at a too-tight size Large, or having FOMO after finding myself unable to buy from a popular plus-size spot. Often, girls who fall somewhere in the middle – usually between sizes 10 and 14 – don’t have a perfect place in the fashion world, so I decided to seek out more mid-size content creators and discover the fashion inspiration I deserved. It wasn’t that I only wanted to follow people that looked like me; I just couldn’t help but admit how nice it felt to see myself represented in the content I consumed.</p><p>With this goal in mind, I set out to fill my feed with as many mid-size influencers as I could. Using hashtags like #midsizecollective and #averagegirlsize, I quickly found a bevy of beautiful accounts, ones with posts I instantly started bookmarking and screenshotting. Inspo, unlocked! Users like Holly of <a href=# rel=nofollow>@thekittyluxe</a> had me <i>this close</i>&nbsp;to moving to London to check out the British high street shopping scene, while others, like Karina of <a href=# rel=nofollow>@styleidealist</a>, convinced me to give tailored pants and statement-making dresses a second chance. And of course, <a href=# rel=nofollow>my friend Gisele</a> is a forever fave for fashion inspo.</p><p>It’s not that this mid-size content was any better or worse than that of the other influencers I already followed, but I was able to picture myself in these OOTDs with a tiny bit more ease. It was exciting to see women who looked like me killing it in looks I’d never dreamed I could ever pull off. With my new follows came a resurgence of confidence in my body, and an excitement to <a href=#>try out new looks</a> based on my newfound inspiration.</p><p>It’s safe to say my shopping has been at an all-time high since following more mid-size fashionistas, but TBH, so has my self-esteem. In the end, that totally justifies a few extra online shopping binges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ynrdKhoKimXam2sb%2BOamdxamlqhXC5yJ1krKGqmnqnrdKhoKimXZe5sLPGnqmsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eco-friendly-innovations-in-food-packaging.html><span>←</span><span>4 Most Exciting Eco-Friendly Innovations in Food Packaging| The Enterprise World</span></a>

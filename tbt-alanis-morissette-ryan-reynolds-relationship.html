Case in point:&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ryan Reynolds</a>&nbsp;(not to be&nbsp;confused with Ben Affleck, by the way) and singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. Not only did these two lovebirds date, but they were also engaged (despite never having made it down the aisle). Before their breakup in 2007, the&nbsp;Van Wilder&nbsp;star and the&nbsp;Jagged Little Pill&nbsp;artist were one of our favorite couples in the mid-2000s (besides&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kirsten Dunst and Jake Gyllenhaal</a>, of course).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the peak of their relationship, the pair were often seen supporting each other at industry events — with a nice helping of PDA thrown in. The musician had a lot of wonderfully weird things to say about her movie star beau. She once&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told&nbsp;People</a>&nbsp;she felt "so loved by him, in a trampoline kind of way." She also said that Reynolds was "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>like a soul brother</a>" to her, with an important distinction, "except that I want to jump his bones."

They reportedly met at the&nbsp;Charlie's Angels&nbsp;star's 27th birthday bash,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>according to&nbsp;People</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-february-2003-ryan-reynolds-and-alanis-morissette-are-first-spotted-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>February 2003: Ryan Reynolds and Alanis Morissette are first spotted together</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was a big year out for the couple in 2003. Reynolds and Morissette made a number of appearances at award shows, festivals, and other events — Juno Awards, MTV Movie & TV Awards, and Tribeca Film Festival, to name a few — as each other's plus one.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-june-2004-ryan-reynolds-and-alanis-morissette-get-engaged></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>June 2004: Ryan Reynolds and Alanis Morissette get engaged</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gregory Pace/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2004, Morissette and Reynolds took their relationship to the next level when they got engaged.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We have the perfect combination of compatibility and incompatibility that makes the relationship very passionate. It's perfect.

By July, they were spotted doing couple activities like going for strolls, holding hands, kissing — from Vancouver to New York City.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-february-2007-ryan-reynolds-and-alanis-morissette-break-up-after-reuniting></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>February 2007: Ryan Reynolds and Alanis Morissette break up after reuniting</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Ron Galella / Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although their initial split appeared to be a false alarm, their second breakup — which came less than a year later — was official. After a nearly three-year engagement, Reynolds and Morissette&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>announced their separation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They remain close friends and continue to have the utmost love and admiration for each other. They ask that their privacy be respected surrounding this personal matter," their reps&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>shared in a statement to&nbsp;People</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's unclear precisely what caused the split, but in true singer-songwriter fashion, Morissette channeled her post-breakup angst into music. Her 2008 album,&nbsp;Flavors of Entanglement,&nbsp;addresses the fallout, with her track "Torch" acting as the most direct link.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Access</a>&nbsp;of the song, "It’s really about my grief." The record boasts lyrics like, "I miss your smell, and your style, and your pure abiding way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>admitted to&nbsp;Women's Health</a>&nbsp;during this time that she got "angry" at herself "for staying in relationships way too long," though she never specified her romance with Reynolds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, it's safe to say that the high-profile aspect of her relationship contributed to its end. During an&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>interview with&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly</a>, she said she'd be "avoiding [public romance] in the future."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think it's the straw that breaks the camel's back," Morissette&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told the&nbsp;Los Angeles Times</a>&nbsp;of her split from Reynolds. "I was a full-blown love addict, so it was like, 'I can't keep doing this, my body can't take it.' For someone who is a love addict, [breakups are] debilitating."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, "I've been on a constant journey toward finally surrendering and hitting the rock bottom that I've been avoiding my whole life. So this was a huge, critical juncture for me. Everything broke, and it was an amazing and horrifying time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reynolds kept his emotional journey closer to the chest and began dating actress&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Scarlett Johansson</a>&nbsp;soon after he and Morissette called it quits. News of their engagement broke around the same time that Morissette's breakup album was released, which also coincided with the release of ScarJo's debut album&nbsp;Anywhere I Rest My Head. Isn't it&nbsp;ironic? (She&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>told&nbsp;Newsweek</a>&nbsp;she was "really happy for him," by the way.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of "Ironic," the only times Reynolds has spoken on the record about his ex have been really, really weird. In 2016, while promoting&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;on the&nbsp;TODAY&nbsp;show, he began singing along to Morissette's 1995 hit, uttering the line "Isn't it ironic?" in falsetto before asking then-host&nbsp;Matt Lauer, "Don't you think?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That same year, in an interview he did as Deadpool with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>, he told the publication that his favorite holiday was Alanis Morissette Day (which is a real thing, FYI). Apparently, he pulled his "Ironic" shtick during an interview in 2017, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGekl8FurcuapaKrXaK8s7XSrJytrJViv7qtzWapnrGepLmlv4yrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-teal-dresses-royal-variety.html><span>←</span><span>Princess Kate dazzles in teal dress: Here are 5 you can shop now</span></a>

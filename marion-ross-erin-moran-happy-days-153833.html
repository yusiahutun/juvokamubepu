When Closer then asked Marion, 89, how the Happy Days cast continues to keeps Erin’s memory alive, she replied, “We all talk about it as much as we want to.” While speaking to Closer, Marion also revealed that her former co-stars helped her write her upcoming book, <a href=#>My Days: Happy and Otherwise</a>.</p><p>“Look for that at the end of March. All the Happy Days family wrote parts of it,” Marion shared. The red-headed beauty additionally revealed that she has “thousands” of favorite memories from the show, especially from the cast’s softball team. “I’m a very good softball player. I don’t sit down a lot! Like most women, we keep moving all the time. We do everything,” she joked.</p><p>While recently participating in the American Heart Association and Macy’s Go Red for Women event, Marion shared that the fashion show’s cause hit especially close to home. “Heart disease is in my family. My mother, my father, my husband, all died from it — and now, I’m 89, and so I take the good appeals from my heart and you can be heart healthy if you work on it and become aware,” she explained. “We’re all so aware now, and I’m very grateful to Macy’s for putting on this show.”</p><p>For more exclusive content, sign up for our Closer Weekly <a href=#>newsletter</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKuhn6N6s7vSrGSeqpmjeq670ZqlZqCRpb26ecOasKxlYWqAeX%2BSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jack-osbourne-finds-mom-sharon-unconscious-on-night-of-terror.html><span>←</span><span>Jack Osbourne Finds Mom Sharon Unconscious After Communicating With Spirits On 'Night Of Terror'</span></a>

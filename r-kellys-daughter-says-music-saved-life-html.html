He pleaded not guilty in federal court to charges that he sexually abused women and girls who attended his concerts there. He has been accused of using his fame to recruit young women and girls into illegal sexual activity, and has also been charged in Chicago and Minnesota for separate incidents. While he had been dogged by allegations that he abused women for years (a charge he denies) , scrutiny from January's highly rated Lifetime documentary 'Surviving R. Kelly,' which detailed multiple allegations against him, led to new investigations and new charges (among his legal troubles is also a backlog in child support for his children, including Abi).</p><img id=i-5609f8c73c470e82 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/05/02/18086124-7427957-image-m-40_1567647249668.jpg height=663 width=634 alt="In the last five years she's been hard at work on her debut EP, 'Don't Call Me,' released this March.

While the rest of the world has set International Coffee Day on October 1, the US and Canada celebrate National Coffee Day this Thursday, September 29. Our favorite cafés and shops are offering deals to perk us up as we settle into fall. Check out these sweet freebies, from a free coffee to start your day to a free baked good with any purchase — and find out which stores are not participating.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dunkin’ Donuts</h2><p>All day tomorrow, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dunkin’ is offering</a> one free hot or iced coffee per customer with any purchase. Here are the rules surrounding the freebie:</p><ul><li>It’s a medium size.</li><li>Coffees available for free: Dunkin’s Original Blend or Dunkin’s Limited Batch Series coffees, 100 percent Guatemalan Hot Coffee, or Dunkin’ Midnight Hot Coffee. (Nitro cold brew and cold brew beverages are excluded.)</li><li>You must be a DD Perks member. Sign up is free: Visit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DDPerks.com</a> and click the Sign Up button.</li><li>The offer excludes purchases made with gift cards.</li><li>No purchase minimum.</li></ul><p>Bonus: If you’re visiting Dunkin,’ fall-themed menu items include pumpkin donuts, pumpkin muffins, and apple cider donuts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kolache Factory</h2><p>Though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kolache Factory</a> has just <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">57 locations nationwide</a> (primarily in the midwest, south, and northeast) this café and bakery is hoping to make a splash on National Coffee Day with a fun deal. Customers can get one free 12-ounce cup of coffee by finding the promotion coupon online and showing it to the cashier. Here’s how to find the coupon:</p><li>Visit the Kolache Factory <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> page.</li><li>Locate the National Coffee Day post. Show this post (the coupon) to the cashier at Kolache Factory. (Some locations may allow you to get your free coffee simply by mentioning the deal, but having the picture on your phone is a good backup.) Note: This offer is only valid for in-store and drive-thru purchases. Online orders are excluded.</li><p>Bonus: Sign up for the e-club at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KolacheFactory.com/eclub</a>. You’ll receive a sign-up offer of “buy three, get three” kolaches — so you’ll have six to share with your family while you enjoy your free cup of joe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Krispy Kreme</h2><p>Want a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">free coffee and a free doughnut</a>? If you’re a Krispy Kreme Rewards member, you can get a free doughnut of your choice and a free brewed coffee. Here are the rules:</p><ul><li>No purchase necessary. The free coffee and doughnut are available for carry-out and via drive-thru at participating shops across the US.</li><li>Become a rewards member by signing up on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KrispyKreme.com/rewards</a>.</li><li>If you aren’t a rewards member, you can still get a free coffee — just not a free doughnut.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Panera Bread</h2><p>Not a member of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Panera Unlimited Sip Club</a>? September 29 is a great day to join. If you subscribe today, you’ll get <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two months free</a> (and you’re free to cancel after two months if you’re no longer interested). Existing Sip Club Members receive $2 off select barista beverages and smoothies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Peet’s Coffee</h2><p>Lucky us: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peet’s is offering more than one deal</a> on National Coffee Day. If you visit the coffee shop tomorrow, you can get a free small drip coffee with any purchase. You can also buy Peet’s K-cup pods and espresso capsules in-store for 20 percent off, from September 29 through October 2.</p><p>Can’t visit in store? Check out these online deals:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peets.com</a> is offering 20 percent off site-wide September 29 through October 2.</li><li>Get free delivery when you purchase on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peet’s mobile app</a> September 29 through October 1.</li></ul><p>If you miss this window of opportunity, fear not: Peet’s gives customers one free small coffee with purchase of one-pound bag of beans in-store anytime. (Limit one per customer).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Starbucks</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNET</a>, Starbucks is not participating in National Coffee Day this year. However, there is still a way to get unlimited free refills. “At participating stores, you can use your registered Starbucks Card or&nbsp;Starbucks&nbsp;app to purchase a beverage and then present that same Starbucks Card or&nbsp;Starbucks&nbsp;account in the&nbsp;app to get free refills of brewed coffee (hot, Iced&nbsp;Coffee or Cold Brew), and tea (hot or iced, not including lemonade),” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Starbucks.com</a> says. Here are the caveats:</p><ul><li>You must have used a Starbucks card or the phone app to buy the original beverage.</li><li>The offer is only available per single store visit. (Once you leave the store, your visit has ended and you’ll have to make a new purchase to get another cup.)</li><li>Refills are not available at the drive-thru.</li><li>Not all locations participate in the deal. To find out whether your local store participates, ask at the counter. (Note: Most locations with tables and chairs participate, because it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">boosts the Starbucks brand</a>.)</li></ul><p>The types of drinks you can refill for free are limited — if you got a pumpkin spice latte to start, for example, you can only get a hot coffee as a refill. However, an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">employee once shared a helpful trick</a>: Just ask for certain add-ons to make it more tasty. For instance: To create a similar pumpkin-spiced coffee without technically ordering one, ask for hot coffee with extra steamed milk and pumpkin spice syrup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJoqqGnoKW2r7OOp5itoZ%2Bjrq15wqidn52VYrGixYxrZ2tq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./make-something-good-today-a-memoir.html><span>←</span><span>Make Something Good Today Laurel Mercantile</span></a>

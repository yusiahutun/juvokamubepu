<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Meaning of Violent Crimes by Kanye West</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In Kanye West's song "Violent Crimes," the overall theme revolves around the rapper's personal growth and newfound perspective on women and fatherhood. It explores the dichotomy between his previous behavior as a man and how having daughters has drastically shifted his worldview.One standout lyric in the song is "I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster." This lyric showcases Kanye's desire for his daughter to possess strength and independence, like the iconic rapper Nicki Minaj. It also speaks to the theme of empowerment, highlighting the importance of nurturing female talent and encouraging young girls to break free from societal expectations.Another significant lyric is "I pray your body's draped more like mine and not like your mommy's." This line delves into the topic of body image and self-acceptance. Kanye expresses his concern that his daughter may inherit her mother's physical features, which suggests a societal pressure for women to conform to a certain standard of beauty. This theme emphasizes the need for a shift in beauty ideals and the importance of embracing one's unique and natural appearance.Additionally, the lyric "If you whoop her ass, she move in with him, then he whoop her ass, you go through it again" delves into the cycle of domestic violence and its impact on families. It explores the theme of breaking vicious cycles and challenges the notion that violence is an appropriate or effective form of discipline. This lyric highlights the need for healthier outlets to address conflicts and promote healthy relationships.Furthermore, the repetition of the line "N_ggas is pimps, n_ggas is players, 'til n_ggas have daughters" underscores the theme of karma or retribution. Kanye suggests that men who once objectified and took advantage of women may change their perspective when they become fathers to daughters. This theme addresses the need for empathy and respect, reminding listeners of the interconnectedness of humanity.In conclusion, "Violent Crimes" by Kanye West explores the transformation in perspective that occurs when one becomes a parent, particularly a father to daughters. The song delves into themes of female empowerment, body image, cycles of violence, and personal growth. Through introspective lyrics, Kanye provides a thoughtful commentary on the societal issues surrounding the treatment and perception of women, ultimately shedding light on the importance of empathy, respect, and nurturing in relationships.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonysrc2ynGavlajBcLnEmqWippdivKd51aKmpZ2eqXqkvsimnKxlkq56rK3Nspxmr5WowQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./01-0190-20230909-614-836-directo-html.html><span>←</span><span>Fase de clasificacin al Mundial, Sudamrica: Brasil vs Bolivia EN VIVO.

Especially, his expertise in creating fast-food cakes like McDonald’s and Taco Bell put him right amongst the top bakers in the field. No wonder, he was one of the contestants on Netflix’s 2022 reality baking competition “</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Is It Cake?</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This “Jonny Manganello Bio” explores his life.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Jonny Manganello On Netflix’s Is It Cake?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Netflix’s “</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Is It Cake?</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>” premiered on March 18, 2022, and it saw nine bakers including Jonny, going head to head to create hyper-realistic cakes to impress the panel of judges — Bobby Moynihan, Loni Love, Michael Yo, Fortune Feimster, Rebecca Black, King Princess, Arturo Castro, and Heidi Gardner.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for the co-contestants joining Jonny in this inaugural season, they were — Andrew Fuller, April Julian, Dessiree Salaverria, Hemu Basu, Justin Rasmussen-Ellen, Nina Charles, Sam Cade, and Steve Weiss — each blessed with their own set of skills.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, since this was a reality competition, there could be only one winner.</span></p><p><b>Spoilers Alert:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Sadly, it wasn’t Jonny.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, after a tight battle between the final three, it was Andrew Fuller who beat out fellow finalists, Hemu Basu and April Julian. The final task for the top 3 was to fool the three celebrity guests, where Andrew created an intricately detailed leather-looking suitcase.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As promised, Andrew walked out with the £50,000 grand prize plus the extra £30,000 he won over the “winner stays on” relay part of the competition.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But he wasn’t the only one who went home with cash in his hand. Hemu was awarded $10,000 for her work in the “winner stays on,” meanwhile, April got $15,000.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, our star, Jonny earned himself $10,000 (initially $5,000, which was doubled in the “Cake Or Cash” round).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before the show’s premiere, Jonny had made an IG post captioned, “Omg NETFLIX here I come! So excited to be a part of Is It Cake? Can’t say much, but this is a special one.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And it indeed was a “special one” for him.</span></p><h3><b>Jonny Manganello Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jonny Manganello is a baker and a cake artist. He owned </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Jonny Cakes</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, a bakery that specialized in custom, super personalized cakes based in West Hollywood, California.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But unlike his “</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Is It Cake?</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>” co-contestants, Jonny doesn’t have much experience in the baking field. According to Jonny, he only started baking in the summer of 2018. However, despite being relatively new, this talented baker made up for it by spending a sheer amount of time in the kitchen. “I do it every single day, all the time, and built a business for myself,” he explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking about the challenges he’s faced in his career, Jonny shared that he had trouble with pricing his cakes. Since it took him over two days to make one, a lot of people would be surprised by the amount of time, energy, and supplies, and of course the money. “If I’m not paying myself fairly, I’m just screwing myself over,” he remarked.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides running his shop, this </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Grosse Pointe South</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> graduate also actively participated in any baking competitions (on or off-screen). Before “</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Is It Cake?</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>”, Jonny was in Food Network’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Holiday Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 2. This was his first reality show, and he shared that it was a “dream come true.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For any aspiring baker out there, Jonny asks them to&nbsp; “work slow and steady.” He says that cake baking and decorating is artful as much as it is scientific. “Let your cakes cool completely before decorating, spread the work out over a few days, and take time away from your work so you can see it with a new set of eyes. Baking and decorating should be fun and calming. Don’t rush the process,” he explained.</span></p><h3><b>Does Jonny Manganello Have A Partner?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Jonny Manganello didn’t have a partner as of March 2022. He was “painfully single” then. Yes, “painfully single,” that was what he labeled his cake — the very cake he spent his 2022 valentines day with.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Looking at his past relationship, its unclear what happed between Jonny and his former partner. All we know about his “ex” from his tweets is that he might have cheated on Jonny, he barely uses social media, and he got engaged in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, his “ex” was kind of “immature.” But then again, Jonny once tweeted, “If you think I’m gonna start dating more mature men, twink again.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in 2017, Jonny was still searching for love on dating apps.</span></p><h3><b>Jonny Manganello Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jonny Manganello was 30 years of when he filmed “</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Is It Cake?</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>” However, he was 31 by the time the show aired in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He celebrates his birthday on March 2, making him of the Pisces zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Jonny Manganello Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jonny Manganello stands tall at a height above 6 feet (183 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His district features included — an oblong face and brown eyes.</span></p><h3><b>Is Jonny Manganello On TikTok And Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, as of March 2022, Jonny flaunted 701K followers over TikTok @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>thejonnycakes</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and 25.5K followers over Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>thejonnycakes</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s his Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>jonnymangs</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Jonny Manganello From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jonny Manganello hails from Grosse Pointe, Michigan, US.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He shared that he loves his hometown and it is his favorite place to visit.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>What Do We Know About Jonny Manganello Family?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jonny has a massive Lebanese family with 30 first cousins, 20 aunts, and uncles — and that’s just from his mom’s side.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He comes from a household full of “artists and funny people,” which was also one of the reasons why he’s “always been a little off.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of 2022, his dad lived in Royal Oak while his mother resided in Harper Woods.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>We have no information about his brother.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in 2020, a story about Jonny letting his mom into the gay lingo and slang was making the news.

The 34-year-old Kansas City Chiefs player’s groovy dance steps for the charity event of Operation Breakthrough went viral. <a href=#>Travis</a> was busting moves to Aretha Franklin’s 1967 hit Respect.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1862866248-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dance-mom-abby-lee-miller-claims-taylor-swift-has-pigeon-toes>Dance mom Abby Lee Miller claims Taylor Swift has pigeon toes</h2><p>American choreographer and dance teacher Abby Lee Miller is unhappy with 12-times-Grammy-winning star Swift’s dance moves. The 58-year-old <a href=# rel=nofollow>says</a>, “Taylor Swift is pigeon-toed…and her boyfriend is a much better dancer. Let’s leave it at that.”</p><p>Abby is impressed with Travis’s moves and calls him ‘a natural.’ She gushes over the <a href=#>Catching Kelce</a>‘s star’s talent as she wrote on <a href=#>TikTok</a>: “I think he’s a natural. Most football players like to show off. He’s a showman with swagger at heart.”</p><p>While Travis has impressed Abby, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> is not too ‘hopeful’ about Tay Tay’s dancing skills. The choreographer says, “It’s too late. I don’t think she’s worried about it. I don’t think that’s her top priority right now. However, I think she does probably think that she should have danced as a kid. You know, they had her slumped over that guitar playing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1785029554-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-imperfect-dancing-makes-her-more-relatable>Taylor Swift’s ‘imperfect dancing’ makes her more relatable</h2><p><a href=#>Music</a> legend Taylor Swift’s moves make her more relatable to fans, dance critic Brian Seibert stated after experiencing the Eras Tour. The author said: “This imperfect dancing is, I think, part of her nonthreatening Everywoman image. It makes her easier to identify with.”</p><p>Taylor Swift is known to be the creator of the most popular breakup anthem of our generation and Brian says that even her dance moves make her more identifiable with her audience.</p><p>“And that is what the whole concert is about, the identification between Swift and the fans she continually thanks and flatters the fans who know every word to every song. Swift told the L.A. crowd that when those fans sing her lyrics along with her, she takes that as a sign that they too have felt what she felt.</p><p>It makes sense, then, that she moves the way anyone might move. So that anyone might imagine being her — just pointing and feeling powerful.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eFcMDVZqqtmaJiwKLF0marq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lmah6onnBnqutnaJisaK6wp6pZqyYlrtuvMignKimXam8prCMrZiypJ%2BnerTDyJ%2BraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eva-naturals-vitamin-c-serum-amazon.html><span>←</span><span>This Eva Naturals Vitamin C Retinol Serum Is on Sale at Amazon For $15</span></a>

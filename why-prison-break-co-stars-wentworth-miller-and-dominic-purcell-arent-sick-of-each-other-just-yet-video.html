The original show went off the air after four seasons in 2009, with a 2010 video game based on the series following shortly after. Jump forward a few years and the two appeared as a villainous team on "The Flash" in 2014, before their characters were spun off onto "Legends of Tomorrow."</p><p>It was then that they talked about revisiting the roles that made them famous, prompting the 2017 "Prison Break" reboot.</p><p>With all these projects, plus fan conventions and publicity tours, we had to ask: aren't you guys sick of each other yet?</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/84/16by9/2017/04/04/8477fdee3a0d5102a9709ea899c66c00_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"Never. Wentworth's one of my dearest friends. It's always a pleasure just being with him," Purcell told TooFab at WonderCon. "When he's moody, I leave him alone. When I'm moody, he leaves me alone."</p><p>"We get each other," added Miller. "We get when to be up in each other's faces and when to give each other some space."</p><p>In the 12 years since the OG series aired, a lot has changed, most notably: their ages. Purcell is now 47, while Miller turns 45 in June.</p><p>"[Filming] the new one, for me, I noticed straight away that I, Dominic, was a lot older and making different choices than I would have as a younger man," Purcell explained. "There's a certain weight to Lincoln that's a lot heavier I believe than the last seasons."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e2026b4e-c556-5784-a9b4-fa1ba86993b0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a7aa8f4a-5d47-506a-b820-6d63ff8007cc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0d/5by4/2016/03/29/0d56ffde56af5bea8c04a4f350a0353b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Everett Collection/SplashNewsOnline.com</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Wentworth Miller Fights Back Against Body Shaming Meme, Shares Powerful Message About Suicide & Weight Struggle</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I considered it a rare gift to go back and revisit a character that was so meaningful to me at 43-44 and play him more as a man than I did originally, when both he and myself were man boys," added Miller. "I think you can feel that quality onscreen, it translates."</p><p>The guys thank to Netflix generation for keeping interest in the series alive, as Purcell said he still gets 10-year-olds coming up to him explaining how much they love the show. "It's still really relevant," he added, "That's kind of a classic thing with TV, films, they're timeless. I think 'Prison Break' has that quality."</p><p>Watch the video above to see which classic show Purcell would love to see get a reboot -- and how he'd like to be involved.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2e/16by9/2017/04/04/2ea69e55d74e5f71a05affbc5ef14f5e_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Of course, there's one big question that many fans have been wondering since the revival was announced: how the hell is Michael Scofield still alive?</p><p>Miller's character was seemingly killed off in the series finale, something that has to be explained away when the new series starts. While we all know Michael is somehow alive, producers Vaun Wilmott and Michael Hororwitz told TooFab the 'How' won't be immediately answered.</p><p>"I know [creator Paul Scheuring] worked on it for a long time and had a really complicated, great answer for it that we're really excited about and it actually," Horowitz explained. "You were saying you might know the answer by the end of the first [episode]. That is not going to happen. You are not gonna know a lot for a while. It is a big mystery and we think the solution is really fun."</p><p>"It had to be good enough and big enough but also feel fresh, as part of the Prison Break universe," added Wilmott. "It had to be an idea that was worthy of bringing him back."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dee00991-0e32-5c5a-9c6b-b2e425074f22 data-container-ref=toofab:article:a7aa8f4a-5d47-506a-b820-6d63ff8007cc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/89/5by4/2016/06/08/898c18a01d095dabba296b7693ebe1d6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">"Prison Break" Star Dominic Purcell Reveals Plastic Surgery Results After Busting Up His Face on Set</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The two were hesitant to give any other details about what to expect, wary of today's spoiler culture.</p><p>"Man, people want to know spoilers so badly and I know and I understand why you're asking and I understand why people want to know," said Horowitz. "We feel like we're giving away too much."</p><p>Wilmott only teased the "international aspect" of the new season. "I think people are going to feel that it's gone to a very epic scale," he added, "it feels like a movie, it feels like a 9-episode movie."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5d/16by9/2017/04/04/5d0208129f735d1d8441066365ab9864_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Joining the show for the fifth season is newcomer Inbar Lavi, who also chose her words very carefully when teasing how she fits in to the big picture.</p><p>"I don't want to ruin it! Why does everyone want to ruin it?" she asked. "Part of the fun of the show is that you don't know what's gonna happen, if the car's gonna blow up or fall off the ... I can tell you you'll be at the edge of your seat and it's going to be explosive!"</p><p>"I got to work with Rockmond Dunbar who plays C-Note and Dominic and they're these two big intimidating dudes and I didn't know what to expect," she added of her first days on set. "Rockmond turned into this huge teddy bear who just is there to support and love and push you and make you feel good. And Dominic was just so cool, like too cool for school. I felt right at home, they made me feel really welcome."</p><p>Lavi is just ready for fans to see what they've been working on.</p><p>"We filmed forever ago and it feels like we filmed forever and it's finally out and we get to hear people's reaction. The fans have been waiting for so long and it's really exciting."</p><p>"Prison Break" premiers Tuesday, April 4 at 9pm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7j21maWxfrLW6ec%2BroKynnmKvs7HApGScp12owaK%2B0maunqakrLyzwMdmpKKknJq%2Fbq3NnWSdp52eu6qvjKmsq5uVoblurdGepa1lo56wrHnOn2SemZOderDAx56pZqKlqMFuxcStZK%2BhlJq8cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barry-gibb-keith-urban-ive-gotta-get-a-message-to-you-listen.html><span>←</span><span>Keith Urban, Barry Gibb Team on 'I've Gotta Get a Message to You'</span></a>

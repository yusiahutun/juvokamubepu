Claudia stated that her daughter, who was eight at the time, had brushed against a candle which had led to her costume catching alight. After the incident, the government subsequently tightened the regulations around costume standards. Thankfully, Matilda made a full recovery.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eAXOd034UcvP><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/326b8640fa7f-claudia-and-husband-z.jpg></strong><p id=eZLXBEVfWqWr data-wc=100>In July, Claudia revealed she nearly walked away from her presenting stint with Strictly. Appearing on Radio 4's Woman's Hour, the TV star said she phoned the bosses "in tears" because of her fear that the show would clash with her son's move to university. "I phoned the boss of Strictly&nbsp;quite dramatically and said, through tears, 'Sarah I love you. I don't want to leave Strictly&nbsp;and Tess and I have agreed we will leave together when they're done with us, but if the first show is September 13, I'm out and you'll have to go with somebody else.'"</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Strictly Come Dating: couples who met on the dancefloor</h3><p id=e6V6RE8a2S>As well as Gemma and Gorka, there are several other loved-up couples who met during their time on Strictly…</p><ul><li>Janette Manrara and Aljaz Škorjanec met on Strictly in 2010, before marrying in 2017 and welcoming a baby, Lyra, in 2023.</li><li>Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev met during the 2013 series.

It's clear that Claudia followed in her parent's footsteps by working in the media, as her mum and dad were both journalists. Mum Eve is the former editor of the&nbsp;Sunday Express&nbsp;and her father was a book publisher. After her parents split, her mum got married again to the former editor of the Daily Express, Nicholas Lloyd, and her father also remarried to children's author Cindy Black.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1cfdeed53467-claudia-winkleman-and-mum-z.jpg><h2>Claudia Winkleman's siblings</h2><p id=ewAU-CQMtCwc data-wc=87>Claudia was born an only child but gained siblings after her parent's divorce through their subsequent marriages.

Sophie has appeared in shows such as Peep Show and Two and a Half Men alongside Ashton Kutcher throughout her career.

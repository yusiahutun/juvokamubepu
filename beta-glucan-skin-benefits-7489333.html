"It is naturally produced by bacteria, fungi, and lichens, mimicking the natural structures found in the top layer of our skin and acting as a phenomenal humectant." (A humectant, for the uninitiated, is a molecule that attracts water.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Natalie Aguilar</a>, a celebrity facialist and dermatological nurse in Los Angeles, also points out that beta-glucan is found in many food products, including oats, barley, seaweed, and rye. Of them, she adds that oats have some of the highest concentration of beta-glucan — hence the therapeutic nature of oat extract and oatmeal products.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-many-benefits-of-beta-glucan-for-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The (Many) Benefits of Beta-Glucan for Skin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>Beta-glucan benefits in four primary ways, says Dr. Parsa: It imparts hydration, boosts skin barrier function, addresses signs of aging, and helps heal. These avenues of skin health yield synergistic benefits that contribute to your skin's overall immune function, aiding with wound healing, eczema, dermatitis, and beyond. Here, exactly how it achieves those benefits:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hydration and Barrier Support</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The hydrating and barrier-support functions of beta-glucan go hand-in-hand, plumping skin while retaining hydration. "While hyaluronic acid is [known for its ability to] retain and hold water, beta glucan works by improving the skin's natural ability to retain moisture," says Aguilar.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Supporting the skin barrier helps offset with trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) —&nbsp;through which water literally evaporates from skin — and as a result can help alleviate dry, dehydrated, or barrier-compromised skin. This renders reactive and compromised skin less susceptible to pathogens and environmental aggressors — which can treat, soothe, and prevent inflammatory sources of skin eruptions like eczema and some types of acne..</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Defense Against Signs of Aging</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hydration and retained moisture create a plumping effect, which obviously helps to smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. As a result, beta-glucan can "visibly minimize signs of aging, reducing wrinkle depth and overall roughness," confirms Sobelman. Dr. Parsa also points out that there is also an antioxidant effect, which works by protecting the skin cells against free radical damage — which is one of the leading theories of skin aging.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Wound-Healing Abilities</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beta-glucan's healing function works by empowering the skin's innate immune system. It does so by stimulating the Langerhans cells found in the skin's protective external epidermis. Beta-glucan "binds to specific receptors on the surface of Langerhans cells, which stimulates them to produce cytokines and other immune mediators [that] strengthen the skin's defenses against external stressors, and regulate the skin's immune response," says Aguilar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Its ability to cue cytokines and other regenerative mechanisms explains its anti-inflammatory and pro-healing functions — which she has personally used to treat burns from curling irons to sunburn.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Microbiome Support</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The role beta-glucan can play in the skin's microbiome of beneficial bacterias is also intricately related to skin immunity and health. This balance can be disrupted easily — by stripping cleansers, aggressive treatments, antibiotics, or even antimicrobial active ingredients, for instance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is where beta-glucan's prebiotic function comes in. "Beta-glucan can be used as a food source for beneficial microbes," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Thomas Hitchcock</a>, PhD, chief science office at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Crown Laboratories</a>. "These are turned into short chain fatty acids, such as propionic acids, which do all kinds of good for the skin, such as lowering pH and reducing UV-induced skin pigmentation." A healthy microbiome basically equips the skin with its own built-in self-protective, healing, and regenerative mechanisms.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-sets-beta-glucan-apart-from-other-active-ingredients></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Sets Beta-Glucan Apart From Other Active Ingredients?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>What makes beta glucan unique is its multi-hyphenate nature. It is most easily compared to its fellow polysaccharide, hyaluronic acid, because of their shared hydrophilic properties, meaning they attract water. But as Sobelman points out, hyaluronic acid is a postbiotic — a byproduct of the microbiome — whereas beta glucan is a prebiotic, or fuel for the microbiome.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another advantage: It plays well with other active ingredients, such as niacinamide. To be clear, this is not an "either/or" situation. Aguilar points out that any formula's efficacy will be determined by its purity, potency, and concentration. If anything, it's simply an effective, science-backed skincare ingredient to add to your arsenal, stat.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6rmmWXocKkrc1mqqShnmKvprrEn6Ctq11sgXmFkmxq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-wherever-i-go-tv-version-by-miley-cyrus.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Wherever I Go (TV Version) by Miley Cyrus</span></a>

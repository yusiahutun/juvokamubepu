Her main part is Moon, a young executive who’s lost interest in her marriage to software programmer Fung (Sunny Chan Kam-hung), and has an affair with Jie (Lawrence Ko Yu-luen), a bisexual drifter from Taiwan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/27/23b7436f-3e58-4814-b341-597e10208caa_0faa388c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Moon dies on a business trip, Jie becomes obsessed with Fung, and starts to stalk him, finally revealing his affair with Moon via an answerphone message.</p>Yau’s second role as a woman who runs a fashion boutique is minor. The dual role does not have any impact on the film, and it seems to have been added for fun, perhaps as a nod to the cinematic games of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Wong Kar-wai</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Yau is prominent, the narrative is pinned to Moon’s husband, Fung, who relates her story in flashback while talking to the cheerful real estate agent Tong, played by a gleeful Eric Tsang Chi-wai.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/27/0c7e173e-2d77-484f-a751-710554a1f5c3_cdf1f21a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tong is gay, and initially has sexual designs on Fung, but he ends up enjoying a rewarding platonic relationship with him instead – an unexpected creative choice which adds interest to the film.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yau, in her final film role to date, performs very well, and plays down her sex-bomb image, even though she has some steamy scenes. “Chingmy’s role was quite clear – she was playing an ordinary woman,” Kwan said.</p>Following on from his relatively chaste <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Red Rose, White Rose</span></a>, Kwan started a deeper exploration of sexuality, both gay and heterosexual, with Hold You Tight. The film features a shot of full-frontal male nudity, a gay sex scene involving Tsang, and numerous realistically shot scenes of passion featuring Yau.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Is the ‘brotherly love’ in Hong Kong martial arts films homoerotic?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sunny Chan is the subject of the male nude scene, but it is not meant to be erotic – he is just standing around talking to his wife. Kwan had noticed that European films often featured people in the nude outside of sex scenes, and wanted to try something similar in a Hong Kong film.OPTIONAL CUT ENDS</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwan fully expected a Category III rating for Hold You Tight, but the censors appreciated its artistry, and designated it a Category IIB release.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Lan Yu (2001)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although talk about Lan Yu often revolves around its status as a gay drama, the film’s main point of interest is its style.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwan and screenwriter Jimmy Ngai Shiu-yan take all the tropes of a classic American melodrama – the type of film popularised by Douglas Sirk – and inject them into a gay romance set mainly in Beijing in the 1980s. This creative choice provided an intriguing, highly unusual, mix of genres.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lan Yu is one of Kwan’s most straightforward films, and the simple storyline gives the actors room to roam. Most of Kwan’s films are “directors’ films”, but Lan Yu belongs to its performers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In what is essentially a two-hander – no other characters get a look-in – mainland Chinese actors Hu Jun and Liu Ye bring sensitivity and delicacy to their roles. Their intensity and focus elevate the perfunctory storyline and make it an emotional experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/27/3de2aafe-3dbc-4c1f-991d-5e797c98c715_21ac75c9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The plot is neatly scripted, and more on point than Kwan’s earlier works. Han-dong (Hu), a rich businessman, meets the younger Lan Yu (Liu) in a bar in Beijing. The two fall in love, and Han-dong lavishes gifts on his young lover.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both are happy, until Han-dong succumbs to pressure from his family – his father is a Communist Party official – to marry a woman. The marriage fails, and the two men resume their relationship until Han-dong is imprisoned for corruption.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lan Yu sells a villa and uses the money to bribe officials to release Han-dong. But in classic melodramatic style, Lan Yu dies in an accident on a construction site, leaving his older lover hopelessly lost.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/27/5ee8d269-5bbb-4a1a-9d54-5eaef1949f9d_fb902bfe.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lan Yu is based on three stories about gay men that were anonymously published on the internet in 1998 under the pseudonym ‘Beijing Tongzhi’. (Tongzhi, or “comrade”, was often used to refer to gays.) According to the Post, the stories contained descriptions that verged on the pornographic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The idea to film the stories came from the film’s mainland Chinese producer, Zhang Yongning, who found them moving. He tracked down the author, a woman writer who had emigrated to the United States, secured the rights, and then offered the project to Kwan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Kwan did not want to do it. “One of the things that turned me off initially was how explicit the novel was. The first few pages were actually nothing but graphic sex scenes, and I was not sure how I would inject my style into the project.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How biopic of silent-film star Ruan Lingyu was the making of Maggie Cheung</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwan agreed to direct the film if he could use as screenwriter Ngai, who had written the scripts for Hold You Tight and another of his films, Island Tales. Zhang rejected Ngai’s script as he felt it did not reflect Beijing life, but changed his mind when Kwan threatened to withdraw from the film.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang felt the script would not get the approval of the Communist Party authorities, and decided that they would shoot in secret. “There was a bit of guerilla filmmaking, as we didn’t get official permission from the authorities. We needed to use our ingenuity, especially with the interior sets,” Kwan said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The film’s short and impressionistic depiction of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen crackdown is often mentioned, but it has no bearing on the story – it is more of a plot device for Han-dong to “rescue” Lan Yu. Kwan described it to the Post as “background”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/27/681ab86a-1596-4532-8efd-1fce322c2161_36429b08.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Likewise, the persecution of homosexuals in China, referred to in Zhang Yuan’s groundbreaking 1996 film East Palace, West Palace, is not touched upon. Lan Yu’s focus is wholly on the romance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In this regular feature series on the best of Hong Kong cinema, we examine the legacy of classic films, re-evaluate the careers of its greatest stars, and revisit some of the lesser-known aspects of the beloved industry.</p>Want more articles like this?
